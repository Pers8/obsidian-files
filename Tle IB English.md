$\star$ Analysing various forms of literary and non literary texts
$\star$ Explore cultural significance to gain deeper understanding

- In identifying the text, we have to determine the type of communication you're analysing 
*Ex : Advertisement, speech, social media, post, public signage* 
- Understand the genre and purpose of the text is crucial for the context

2. Contextualize the text 
To contextualize the text explore the historical, social and cultural context in which the text was created. Consider the time period, location and relevant events and movement. For most of the time the authors.

3. Analyse language choices
Examine the language used in the text, including vocabulary, tones, style and rhetoric. Pay attention as well to any culturally specific words, phrases or expressions.

4. Identify cultural references
Look for cultural references, symbols or allusion within the text. These can include references to historical figures, myths, religious symbols or cultural icons.

5. Audience and purpose
Analyse the intended audience and purpose of the communication. Consider how language and content are tailored to resonate with specific audiences.

6. Examine visual elements if applicable
If analysing visual texts, pay attention to the visual elements such as images, colors, layout and design. These can come with cultural meanings and messages.

7. Evaluate stereotypes and bias
Assess whether the text perpetuate stereotypes and biases relative to culture, ethnicity, gender or other social factors. Analyse how  these stereotypes reflect these cultural norms.

# Approaches to non-literary texts

Literary works can generally be grouped into four main forms: 
?
1. poetry
2. prose fiction
3. prose non-fiction
4. drama

- You will examine a wide variety of texts, both literary and non-literary, throughout your Language and Literature course. 
-  Literary works can generally be grouped into four main forms: poetry prose fiction, prose non-fiction and drama 
-  Non-literary texts, however, are categorized by text type, of which there are seemingly number. 
-  If the definition of a text is 'anything from which information can be extracted', then we are encountering - and arguably creating - texts all the time in our daily lives.

- Some texts can be considered literary forms, usually within the non-fiction category (for example, biography, diary, essay, memoir, travel writing). You may indeed focus on a series of letters or a pastiche within your study of literature. However, when studied as a single work (and especially in the context of developing your skills in unseen textual analysis), these text types will be treated as non-literary. 
- You will not be expected to study a prescribed number or type of non-literary texts within the language component of your IB English course of study (the literature component is more prescribed, with a minimum of four works required at Standard Level and six works at Higher Level; the syllabus should include a balance of works in terms of period, place, gender of the author, and literary form), nor will you be expected to learn the features or characteristics of all possible text types.

- The skills of analysing one text type can be transferable to another. It is important not to view these elements in isolation, but to consider how they work together to achieve a specific purpose. The activities will each focus on a specific element, but it is impossible to consider one element without taking into account others; 
- Additionally, we do not want to suggest that you should adopt a linear approach to analysing a text; you may find that tone is the first thing that jumps out at you, or you may be attuned to picking up on o figurative language as you read.
- The purpose Â« these exercises is to give you the tools to analyse with more confidence.

## Content 
?
- An initial reading of any text should focus on content. Only once you have grasped the literal meaning of the text can you begin to consider other layers of meaning. If you start by developing a solid understanding of the content of the text (the what), then you will be able to work towards a more nuanced understanding of the style of the text (the how and why). Jumping in to an analysis of style first will only demonstrate a lack of foundational knowledge.

## Author's message 
?
- As you examine the content of a text, you need to ask yourself what the author's message is. This is not necessarily the same thing as the purpose of the text. The central message is related to larger themes that the text reflects. 
- The following extract from Elizabeth Gilbert's travel memoir Eat Pray Love is a good example of a text with a central message that is distinct from its purpose.

# Travel writing

Features: 
?
- First-person narration
- Focus on a key event/experience
- Appealing to the senses
- Use of humour and anecdotes
- A mix of narration and reflection
- Use of descriptive details

## Content question
?
- What is the text about?
- What is the writer's message?
- What is the writer's attitude (the tone)?
- How does that affect your reading of the text (the mood)?

## Context of Interpretation or reception 
?
What are your circumstances (time and place)? How do these factors influence your reading of the text?

## Structure

Structure refers to:: the form of the text what kind of text is it? what features indicate this? What structural conventions for the text type are used? Does this text conform to the standard conventions?

## Style

Style is:: how the text. How do writers create meaning? What tools (stylistic devices) do they use and to what effect?

## Context of composition or production
?
Consider the time and place the text was produced in, who wrote the text? Why was the text produced the purpose. Who was the text aimed at (the intended audience)? How does the language reflect the target audience

# Context
?
Context refers to the circumstances that surround a text - all of the external factors which are needed to fully understand the text itself.
