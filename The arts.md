3-  *'Every work of art is the child of its age and in many cases, the mother of our emotions, it follows that each period of culture produces an art on its own which can never be repeated.'*  - **Wassily Kandinsky (1866-1944)** 

For each quotation, consider: 
1. Do you agree or disagree with the quotation ? 
**From our understanding we can dissect the quote into three parts and analyse them. We can interpret the first part "Every work of art si the child of its age" by saying that it the identity and definition of art is heavily reliant on its time period or to be more precise the art mouvement because the different styles and themes of are depicted by it's mouvement. We can give the exemple of the mouvement of realism which created a new wave of realist artist. The meaning of the second part could imply that art has the capabilities to move the masses to create predominant emotion and feelings and bring people and cultures together for a singular cause. And from our understanding the last part 'it follows that each period of culture produces an art of its own which can never be repeated.' is trying to tell us that each period of time, each mouvement had its own unique way of making, expressing and interpreting art cannot be completely replicate.**

2. What do you think the quotation suggests about the nature and purpose of the art is refers to? 
**It tells us that art provide different type of emotions and in a different period of time it transfer to us different type of unique ideas depending on the historical context**Ã©

3. Can you identify any implicit or explicit assumptions that the speaker makes about the arts? 
**That art is depend on the period and mouvement. art could move masses and hearts. art of time period cannot be completely replicated because of the context**

4. Do you think the quotation could apply to other areas of knowledge? if so, in what ways? 
**This quotation can be applied in Art and History because it's mainly refering to art and how they provides emotions and how it gives their ideas during a different period of time**

-  What is the arts
The **Arts** include a range of discipline including visual arts, theatre, dance, music, film and literature. The ways in which meaning is encoded, evoked and played out in these various forms of representation do not always overlap and may have no exact counterpart elsewhere. The arts, from the sublime to the mediocre (and even the banal) can provide insight and provoke questions about what it means to be human. Art can be made for its own sake, or created with a functionality in mind like catalyzing social change, conveying overt political or religious messages, and even self-referencetially pushing the boundaries of art itself. 


****Scope***
Is Artistic Knowledge something that cannot be expressed in any other way ?
**Artistic knowledge can be expressed in a lot of other ways, but it often relies on the unique qualities of the medium or form of art being used. While some aspects of artistic knowledge can be communicated through language or other mediums, there may be elements that are difficult to fully express. Artistic knowledge can also include a kind of intuitive understanding that comes from lots of practice and experience, but this understanding can be hard to put into words.**

Does art enlarge what it is possible for us to think and know ?
**Yes, art has the potential to expand what we think and know. Through art, we can explore new ideas, perspectives, and ways of understanding the world. Artistic expression can challenge our assumptions and beliefs, provoke new thoughts and emotions, and expand our imagination and creativity.**

****Perspective***
Can a work of art have meaning of which the artist themselves is unaware ?
**Yes, it's possible for a work of art to have meaning that the artist themselves is unaware of. Once a work of art is completed and released into the world it becomes open to interpretation by others who bring their own experiences, perspectives, and cultural contexts to their understanding of the work. In some cases, the meaning of a work of art may even evolve over time as cultural contexts and interpretations change. For example, a work of art created in one era may be interpreted very differently in a different cultural or historical context.**

How does knowing more about the social, cultural or historical context of a work of art have an impact on our knowledge of the work itself ?
**Knowing the social, cultural, or historical context of a work of art helps us understand the artist's intentions, interpret its meaning, appreciate its craftsmanship, and relate it to broader cultural or historical trends.**

Should your judgments about art be given the same weight as those of an expert ?
**Expert opinions in art may carry more weight in specialized areas, but artistic judgments are subjective and can benefit from a diverse range of perspectives, including those of non-experts.**
