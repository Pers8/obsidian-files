## 1. Consideration for changing to a New System

- **Extent of the change :** There are a few considerations for changing to a new system, and one of them is the extent of the change. Are you completely changing a software system so that the user interface is different and has drastically different features, or are you simply just upgrading the color of the web pages ?
- **Limitation of the new system :** The next consideration is the limitations of the new system, particularly as compared to an older Software System, and what can't you do anymore.
- **Context in which the system will be used :** Finally, we want to take into consideration the context in which the system will be used any **organizational issues** more specifically any issues that the software will create within the company it's being implemented in and any **change in the roles of users** meaning what users can and must do with this software.

### 1.1. Difficulties in changing Software Systems

- Users don't like changes
- Some features may be omitted or left out
- Old systems may be faster and might be a cost for the new system performance
- Incompatibility with other systems 
- Data loss
- Expensive

### 1.2. 4 ways to change to a new system

- **Direct Changeover :** Old system stopped, then new started
- **Parallel :** Old system and new system run concurrently - new data entered into both 
- **Pilot :** New system tested with small part of organization, bug fixed, then expanded
- **Phased :** Introduced in phases, old system gradually phased out

#### 1.2.1. Direct Changeover

**Pros**
- Changeover swift
- New system available immediately

**Cons**
- No backup in case of failure

#### 1.2.2. Parallel Running

**Pros**
- Backup if new system fail
- Output from both system can be compared to verify that new system works correctly

**Cons**
- Running both systems is expensive

#### 1.2.3. Pilot

**Pros**
- All features tested before adoption by whole organization
- Staff who are part of pilot can train others
- If failure, only small part suffers 

**Cons**
- No backup for pilot group in case of failure

#### 1.2.4. Phased Conversion

**Pros**
- Allows people to get used to new system
- Training can be done in stages

**Cons**
- If system fails, no backup for that part of system

### 1.3. Data Migration

- Moving data from one system to another
- Can be huge process depending on sizes of systems
- Necessary when transitioning to new system
- **Possible problems** : Incompatible file formats, Data structure differences, Validations rules, Incomplete data transfers, Different data, currency, or character conventions
