## 1. Consideration for changing to a New System

- **Extent of the change :** There are a few considerations for changing to a new system, and one of them is the extent of the change. Are you completely changing a software system so that the user interface is different and has drastically different features, or are you simply just upgrading the color of the web pages ?
- **Limitation of the new system :** The next consideration is the limitations of the new system, particularly as compared to an older Software System, and what can't you do anymore.
- **Context in which the system will be used :** Finally, we want to take into consideration the context in which the system will be used any **organizational issues** more specifically any issues that the software will create within the company it's being implemented in and any **change in the roles of users** meaning what users can and must do with this software.
