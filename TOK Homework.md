## I-

**What knowledge questions come to mind when assessing political cartoons like this as historical sources?**
The possible questions that come through my mind are :
- To what extend these countries have the possibility to  completely divide China as a piece of cake
- Why the Germany and the England glare each other while Russia, France and Japan are all looking carefully at the piece of cake

## Knowledge questions
### Scope :
**Are all areas of knowledge concerned with knowledge of the past to some extent**
All the areas of knowledge concerned with knowledge of the past because they mainly helped us to build our present through discoveries, innovations and also helped us to develop and improve our life conditions. They also help us to know more how reached that point of development and also people specialized in those areas of knowledge to reconstitute events that happened in the past to have a better understanding of what brought us to where are.

### Perspective :
**How can we gauge the extent to which history is being told from a cultural or national perspective?**
We can gauge the extent to which history is being told from a cultural or national perspective by considering the sources that are being used because if the sources are primarily from one particular culture or nation, it may indicate that the history is being told from that perspective; by evaluate the biases: Another way to gauge the cultural or national perspective of a history narrative is to evaluate the biases of the writer or historian by considering everything that may influence their perspective. Finally by looking for alternative perspectives to provide a more balanced and nuanced understanding of the events and issues being discussed.
### Methods and Tools :
**On what criteria can historians evaluate the reliability of their sources?**
Historians evaluate the reliability of their sources by mainly using these criteria :
$\star$ The credibility of the source
$\star$ The provenance of the source
$\star$ The internal consistency of the source (the degree to which the information contained in the source is consistent with itself)
$\star$ The external consistency of the source (the degree to which the information contained in the source is consistent with other sources)

**Is there less emphasis on collaborative research in history than there is between researchers in other areas of knowledge?**
It is difficult to say for certain whether there is less emphasis on collaborative research in history than in other areas of knowledge, as this can vary depending on the specific field and the individual researchers involved. However, it is generally true that collaborative research is an important part of many fields of knowledge, including history.

**How do the methods and conventions of historians themselves change over time?**
The methods and conventions used by historians can change over time for a variety of reasons. As new evidence and sources become available, historians may need to revise or update their interpretations of the past. Additionally, as historians gain new insights and perspectives, their understanding of the past may change, leading them to adopt new methods and conventions.

### Ethics
**Should terms such as “atrocity” or “hero” be used when writing about history, or should value judgments be avoided?**
It is generally considered best practice for historians to avoid using value judgments, such as terms like "atrocity" or "hero," when writing about history. This is because value judgments can be subjective and can imply a moral or ethical assessment of the events or people being described. As historians, it is important to maintain a neutral and objective perspective when presenting historical information, and to let the evidence speak for itself.

### Connecting to the core theme
**How might the methods of the historian help us to evaluate claims we are exposed to in the media today?**
The methods of the historian can help us to evaluate claims that we are exposed to in the media today by providing a framework for analysing and assessing the evidence behind those claims.

**What ethical concerns are raised by the digitization and online publication of archive material containing people’s personal images and documents?**
The digitization and online publication of archive material containing people's personal images and documents can raise a number of ethical concerns. One of the main concerns is the issue of privacy. When personal images and documents are digitized and made available online, they can be accessed and viewed by anyone with an internet connection, potentially exposing the individuals depicted or referred to in the material to unwanted attention or scrutiny. This can be particularly problematic if the material contains sensitive or confidential information, or if the individuals depicted or referred to in the material did not consent to the digitization and online publication of their images and documents.
