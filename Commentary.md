Introduction: Good morning/afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Today, I would like to present a commentary on an extract from the novel "Houseboy" by Ferdinand Oyono. The extract I will be discussing is as follows: "I was soon to discover that the whiteman was not happy with anyone who was not servile, anyone who dared to show a spirit of independence."

Background and Context: "Houseboy" is a groundbreaking novel published in 1956, written by Ferdinand Oyono, a Cameroonian author and politician. Set during the colonial era, the novel explores the life of a young African boy, Toundi, who works as a houseboy for a French colonial administrator in Cameroon. It deepens into the themes of power, oppression, and the complexities of colonial relationships.

Summary of the Extract: The extract highlights a crucial observation made by the protagonist, Toundi. He quickly realizes that the white colonizers in the novel are displeased by individuals who do not exhibit a subservient nature and dare to display a sense of independence. Toundi's words encapsulate the harsh reality of the colonial system, where the expectation is for African individuals to conform to the role assigned to them, suppressing any aspirations or desires for autonomy.

Analysis:

1.  Power Dynamics and Colonial Oppression: The extract reveals the power dynamics inherent in the colonial relationship. The "whiteman," representative of the colonial authorities, is depicted as enforcing a system that thrives on maintaining control over the native population. The expectation of servility underscores the inherent inequality and oppression within the colonial structure.
    
2.  Suppression of Independence: Toundi's observation sheds light on the limited agency afforded to Africans under colonial rule. The colonizers expect unquestioning obedience, viewing any signs of independence as a threat to their authority. This expectation acts as a tool to subjugate the African population and maintain the status quo of colonial dominance.
    
3.  Struggle for Identity and Autonomy: Toundi's realization sets the stage for his personal journey to reclaim his identity and fight for autonomy. As the narrative progresses, Toundi's spirit of independence will clash with the expectations imposed upon him. This conflict serves as a catalyst for his growth and the exploration of broader themes such as cultural identity and resistance against colonial oppression.
    

Conclusion: In this extract from "Houseboy" by Ferdinand Oyono, we witness a poignant observation made by the protagonist regarding the oppressive nature of colonialism. The expectation for servility and the disdain for independence reveal the power dynamics at play within the colonial system. As readers, we are prompted to reflect on the dehumanizing effects of colonial rule and the struggles faced by individuals like Toundi in asserting their identity and seeking liberation. Oyono's novel offers a powerful critique of colonialism and remains a significant contribution to African literature.

Thank you for your attention.
