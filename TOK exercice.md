## **Mathematics**

**Axiom :** a statement or proposition which is regarded as being established, accepted, or self-evidently true.

**Conjecture :** It's opinion formed on the basis of incomplete information.

**Evidence :** something that provide a proof.

**Justification :** the action of showing something to be right or reasonable.

the equation I chose is E = mc² (and yes it's a mathematical equation), this equation is valid because it has been tested and has been shown to accurately describe the relationship between mass and energy. It has been used in a wide range of fields such as particule physics. The equation is also useful because it allows us to calculate the amount of energy released in nuclear reactions or to estimate the amount of energy required to create a certain amount of matter.

### **Definitions**

**Axioms:** A statement that is taken to be true and serves as a starting point for further argumentation.

**Conjecture:** A conclusion that is formed based on incomplete information; or a conclusion that is not yet accepted as fully certain.

**Evidence:** Information or data that supports or demonstrates a statement, idea, or assertion is referred to as evidence. It is derived via observation, experimentation, or other sorts of investigation and is used to substantiate or support an argument or conclusion.

**Justification:** Justification refers to the process of providing reasons or evidence to support a claim or belief. It is the act of demonstrating that a particular argument or conclusion is reasonable, accurate, and valid. Justification is often used in philosophical, scientific, or legal contexts to prove the validity of a claim or to establish the truthfulness of a proposition.


### **Important**

An axiom is a statement or postulate that is considered to be true. Axioms are used as the basis for subsequent argumentation or reasoning both in logic and mathematics.

  
#### **Concept**

Evidence and justification are important concepts in mathematics and operate uniquely within this AOK. Mathematics is an axiomatic system that uses its own knowledge for evidence and justification for subsequent knowledge production. Knowledge is justified within mathematics if it ‘works’ in accordance with previously established rules and logic. This is all that is necessary for mathematical knowledge to be justified. This justification may seem thin (after all, the evidence for it exists in our minds!) and yet throughout history, mathematics has proved to be incredibly accurate with regard to predictive power. Therefore although not necessary, real-world evidence has also served to justify mathematical knowledge throughout the years.

### **Making connections**  

Mathematics is often used to validate and substantiate claims and can therefore be deployed for the purpose of influencing thinking. It is important to consider how your knowledge of mathematics can help to prevent you being misled by unclear or disingenuous statistics.
