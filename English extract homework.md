In Ferdinand Oyono's "Houseboy," Toundi's experiences with the French colonizers and his fellow Africans highlight the complex power dynamics and social hierarchies of colonial society. Toundi's role as a servant is viewed differently by various characters in the novel. While the French colonizers see him as a subservient and disposable tool, his fellow Africans view him with a mix of envy and contempt for his perceived collaboration with the colonizers.

The extract above demonstrates the oppressive nature of the French colonizers towards Toundi and other African servants, who are expected to remain subservient and obedient to their white masters. This treatment leaves Toundi struggling with his own identity and sense of belonging, as he is forced to navigate between his loyalty to the French and his desire to connect with his fellow Africans.

The photograph of the French colonial administrator and African servants further highlights the power dynamics and social hierarchies of colonial society. The administrator is positioned in the center of the photograph, surrounded by the African servants, who are all dressed in traditional clothing and standing in a subservient posture. This image reinforces the idea that the French colonizers saw themselves as superior and the Africans as inferior, reinforcing the power dynamics that Toundi experiences in the novel.

Overall, Toundi's experiences in "Houseboy" demonstrate the complex nature of colonialism and its impact on both the colonizers and the colonized. The novel highlights the ways in which power dynamics and social hierarchies shape individual identity and sense of belonging, and how these issues can be perpetuated even after colonialism has officially ended.
