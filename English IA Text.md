Let's make a good text for my oral. In the introduction, first talk about what I'm gonna talk about (Global and works and extract) then talk the global issue and how it's still relevant to these days. After do a little transition sentence with some like "Now, let's do a little summary of the 2 literary and non-literary work and the extract " or something maybe better than that. After you do a summary of these and then you will finish the intro by enouncing the main thesis of the intro. Now talk about the extract and explain it clearly by also using for example phrases from the extract to prove your points with evidences and the unpacking evidences too. Do the same thing and really into details with whole literary work and also link it to the global issue. For the non-literary work, describe the painting visually and and explain his relationship with the global issue and at the end of the part link it with the extract and don't forget to follow the bullet points too. Finally conclude it by following the main elements of the bullet point and please make it really complete.
