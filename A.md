VGG16 and ResNet are two popular convolutional neural network (CNN) models that have been pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, which contains over 14 million images of 1000 classes. You can use these models as feature extractors or fine-tune them on your own dataset for your specific task.

To train these models on your own dataset, you will need to follow these steps:

- Prepare your dataset: You will need to have a folder structure that organizes your images into subfolders according to their classes. For example, if you have a dataset of cats and dogs, you will need to have a folder named “cats” and another folder named “dogs”, each containing the images of the respective animals. You will also need to split your dataset into training, validation, and test sets, and store them in separate folders.
- Load the pre-trained models: You can use Keras to load the pre-trained VGG16 and ResNet models from the `keras.applications` module. You can specify the `weights` argument as “imagenet” to load the weights trained on ImageNet, and the `include_top` argument as False to exclude the final classification layer. This will allow you to add your own custom layers on top of the models.
- Add custom layers: You can use the `keras.models.Sequential` class to create a new model that stacks the pre-trained model and your custom layers. For example, you can add a `keras.layers.Flatten` layer to flatten the output of the pre-trained model, and then add a `keras.layers.Dense` layer with the number of classes in your dataset and a softmax activation function. You can also add other layers such as dropout, batch normalization, or activation layers as needed.
- Compile the model: You can use the `compile` method of the `keras.models.Sequential` class to specify the optimizer, loss function, and metrics for your model. For example, you can use the `keras.optimizers.Adam` optimizer, the `keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy` loss function, and the `keras.metrics.CategoricalAccuracy` metric for a multi-class classification problem.
- Train the model: You can use the `fit` method of the `keras.models.Sequential` class to train your model on your dataset. You can specify the number of epochs, batch size, and validation data as arguments. You can also use the `keras.preprocessing.image.ImageDataGenerator` class to create data generators that can augment your images on the fly and feed them to your model. This can help prevent overfitting and improve the generalization of your model.
- Evaluate the model: You can use the `evaluate` method of the `keras.models.Sequential` class to evaluate your model on your test set. You can also use the `predict` method to generate predictions for new images and compare them with the ground truth labels.

To train these models without using a lot of CPU, you will need to use a GPU or a cloud service that provides GPU access. GPUs are much faster and more efficient than CPUs for deep learning tasks, as they can perform parallel computations on large matrices of data. You can use TensorFlow or PyTorch as your deep learning framework, as they support GPU acceleration. You can also use Google Colab, which is a free online platform that allows you to run your code on a GPU.

To train these models with a small number of images, you will need to use some techniques that can improve the performance of your model with limited data. Some of these techniques are:

- Transfer learning: This is the technique of using a pre-trained model as a feature extractor or fine-tuning it on your dataset. This can leverage the knowledge learned from a large dataset and adapt it to your specific task. You can use the pre-trained VGG16 and ResNet models as mentioned above, or you can use other models that are more suitable for your problem domain.
- Data augmentation: This is the technique of applying random transformations to your images, such as rotation, scaling, cropping, flipping, or color adjustment. This can increase the diversity and size of your dataset and reduce the risk of overfitting. You can use the `keras.preprocessing.image.ImageDataGenerator` class as mentioned above, or you can use other libraries such as `imgaug` or `albumentations`.
- Regularization: This is the technique of adding constraints or penalties to your model to prevent it from learning complex or noisy patterns that do not generalize well. This can reduce the variance and improve the stability of your model. You can use regularization techniques such as dropout, weight decay, or batch normalization as mentioned above, or you can use other techniques such as early stopping or learning rate decay.

To prove that ResNet is better than VGG16, you will need to compare their performance on your dataset using some metrics and statistical tests. Some of the metrics that you can use are:

- Accuracy: This is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions. This can measure how well your model can classify the images into the correct classes. You can use the `keras.metrics.CategoricalAccuracy` metric as mentioned above, or you can use other metrics such as precision, recall, or F1-score.
- Loss: This is the value of the loss function that your model tries to minimize during training. This can measure how well your model can fit the data and reduce the error. You can use the `keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy` loss function as mentioned above, or you can use other loss functions such as binary crossentropy, mean squared error, or hinge loss.
- Speed: This is the time that your model takes to train or infer on a given batch of images. This can measure how efficient your model is in terms of computation and memory. You can use the `time` module in Python to measure the speed of your model, or you can use other tools such as `tensorflow-profiler` or `pytorch-profiler`.

To compare the performance of the models, you can use some statistical tests that can tell you if the difference between the models is significant or not. Some of the statistical tests that you can use are:

- T-test: This is a test that compares the means of two groups of data and determines if they are different from each other. You can use the `scipy.stats.ttest_ind` function to perform a t-test on the accuracy or loss values of the models, and check the p-value to see if it is lower than a threshold (such as 0.05). A low p-value means that the difference is statistically significant, and you can reject the null hypothesis that the means are equal.
- ANOVA: This is a test that compares the means of more than two groups of data and determines if they are different from each other. You can use the `scipy.stats.f_oneway` function to perform an ANOVA on the accuracy or loss values of the models, and check the p-value to see if it is lower than a threshold (such as 0.05). A low p-value means that the difference is statistically significant, and you can reject the null hypothesis that the means are equal.
- Bootstrap: This is a technique that resamples your data with replacement and computes the statistics of interest on the resampled data. This can give you an estimate of the variability and confidence intervals of your statistics. You can use the `sklearn.utils.resample` function to perform bootstrap on the accuracy or loss values of the models, and check the mean and standard deviation of the resampled statistics. You can also plot the histograms or boxplots of the resampled statistics to see the distribution and outliers.

The number of images that you will need to train the models and prove that ResNet is better than VGG16 will depend on several factors, such as the complexity and diversity of your dataset, the size and depth of your models, the hyperparameters and optimization methods that you use, and the level of confidence and significance that you want to achieve. There is no definitive answer to this question, but you can use some rules of thumb or empirical methods to estimate the number of images that you will need. Some of these methods are:

- Rule of 10: This is a rule that states that you need at least 10 times the number of parameters in your model as the number of images in your dataset. This can ensure that your model has enough data to learn from and avoid overfitting. For example, if your model has 10 million parameters, you will need at least 100 million images in your dataset. However, this rule is not very accurate, as it does not account for the quality and diversity of the data, the architecture and regularization of the model, and the transfer learning and data augmentation techniques that you use.
- Rule of 30: This is a rule that states that you need at least 30 images per class in your dataset. This can ensure that your model has enough data to learn the features and patterns of each class and avoid underfitting. For example, if you have 10 classes in your dataset, you will need at least 300 images in your dataset. However, this rule is also not very accurate, as it does not account for the complexity and variability of the classes, the size and depth of the model, and the transfer learning and data augmentation techniques that you use.
- Learning curve: This is a plot that shows the relationship between the number of images in your dataset and the performance of your model on the training and validation sets. This can help you determine if your model is underfitting or overfitting, and if you need more data or not. You can use the `matplotlib.pyplot` module to plot the learning curve of your model, and check the following scenarios:
