**Subject:** Cover Letter for Study Visa application – BSc Mathematical and Computational Finance at Concordia University 

Dear Visa Officer, 

My name is Bréal Cicéron Tchuimi Tchuisseu and I am a Cameroonian student residing in Senegal. I have been accepted into the Bachelor of Science (Bsc) in Mathematical and Computational Finance (MACF) program at Concordia University for the Fall 2025 session. I am writing this letter to highlight my academic background, my reason for choosing Canada and my forward-looking goals. 

I graduated with an International Baccalaureate at Le Collège bilingue, in Dakar. During my time at this school, I was nominated as a Modal student and was involved in many extracurricular activities including sports, community service activities and clubs concerning various fields including computer science, mathematics and chess. 

Since high school, my interest in financial markets and problem-solving in mathematics has been growing, which led me to do an internship where I learned about the fundamentals of the stock market, as well as taking part in competitions such as Le Kangourou des Mathématiques and Euclid. The MACF program will help me to learn the computational and modelling techniques and develop an analytical and strategic vision of risk management associated with complex financial transactions. 

Canada is a country renowned for the quality of its education and university system, and Concordia University is one of the most prestigious in Quebec, with high-quality teaching in my field of study. I'm particularly drawn to the program content and co-op opportunities with firms such as DRW. 

After finishing my degree, my goal is to become a skilled quantitative trader and eventually work in an international environment hence I would be looking for worldwide opportunities including my home country Cameroon. 

My higher education in Canada will be entirely financed by my parent’s savings and I will be living with my aunt, who will take care of housing and food expenses.

Studying this program in Canada will be a step toward my professional aspirations and I am committed to making the most of this opportunity. I sincerely hope for a favorable consideration of my study visa application and thank you for your time. 

Sincerely, 
Bréal Cicéron  Tchuimi Tchuisseu
