# Approaches to non-literary texts

Literary works can generally be grouped into four main forms: 
?
1. [[poetry]]
2. [[prose fiction]]
3. [[prose non-fiction]]
4. [[drama]]

- You will examine a wide variety of texts, both literary and non-literary, throughout your Language and Literature course. 
-  Literary works can generally be grouped into four main forms: poetry prose fiction, prose non-fiction and drama 
-  Non-literary texts, however, are categorized by text type, of which there are seemingly number. 
-  If the definition of a text is 'anything from which information can be extracted', then we are encountering - and arguably creating - texts all the time in our daily lives.

- Some texts can be considered literary forms, usually within the non-fiction category (for example, biography, diary, essay, memoir, travel writing). You may indeed focus on a series of letters or a pastiche within your study of literature. However, when studied as a single work (and especially in the context of developing your skills in unseen textual analysis), these text types will be treated as non-literary. 
- You will not be expected to study a prescribed number or type of non-literary texts within the language component of your IB English course of study (the literature component is more prescribed, with a minimum of four works required at Standard Level and six works at Higher Level; the syllabus should include a balance of works in terms of period, place, gender of the author, and literary form), nor will you be expected to learn the features or characteristics of all possible text types.
