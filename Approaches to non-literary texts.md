# Approaches to non-literary texts

Literary works can generally be grouped into four main forms: 
?
1. [[poetry]]
2. [[prose fiction]]
3. [[prose non-fiction]]
4. [[drama]]

- You will examine a wide variety of texts, both literary and non-literary, throughout your Language and Literature course. 
-  Literary works can generally be grouped into four main forms: poetry prose fiction, prose non-fiction and drama 
-  Non-literary texts, however, are categorized by text type, of which there are seemingly number. 
-  If the definition of a text is 'anything from which information can be extracted', then we are encountering - and arguably creating - texts all the time in our daily lives.

- Some texts can be considered literary forms, usually within the non-fiction category (for example, biography, diary, essay, memoir, travel writing). You may indeed focus on a series of letters or a pastiche within your study of literature. However, when studied as a single work (and especially in the context of developing your skills in unseen textual analysis), these text types will be treated as non-literary. 
- You will not be expected to study a prescribed number or type of non-literary texts within the language component of your IB English course of study (the literature component is more prescribed, with a minimum of four works required at Standard Level and six works at Higher Level; the syllabus should include a balance of works in terms of period, place, gender of the author, and literary form), nor will you be expected to learn the features or characteristics of all possible text types.

- The skills of analysing one text type can be transferable to another. It is important not to view these elements in isolation, but to consider how they work together to achieve a specific purpose. The activities will each focus on a specific element, but it is impossible to consider one element without taking into account others; 
- Additionally, we do not want to suggest that you should adopt a linear approach to analysing a text; you may find that tone is the first thing that jumps out at you, or you may be attuned to picking up on o figurative language as you read.
- The purpose Â« these exercises is to give you the tools to analyse with more confidence.

## Content 

- An initial reading of any text should focus on content. Only once you have grasped the literal meaning of the text can you begin to consider other layers of meaning. If you start by developing a solid understanding of the content of the text (the what), then you will be able to work towards a more nuanced understanding of the style of the text (the how and why). Jumping in to an analysis of style first will only demonstrate a lack of foundational knowledge.

## Author's message 

- As you examine the content of a text, you need to ask yourself what the author's message is. This is not necessarily the same thing as the purpose of the text. The central message is related to larger themes that the text reflects. 
- The following extract from Elizabeth Gilbert's travel memoir Eat Pray Love is a good example of a text with a central message that is distinct from its purpose.
