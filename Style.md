Style is:: how the text. How do writers create meaning? What tools (stylistic devices) do they use and to what effect?



Sure, letâ€™s calculate the mean, median, and mode for the list: 10, 20, 20, 20, 30, 30, 40, 50, 70, 70, 80.

1. **Mean**: The mean is the average of all the numbers. $\text{Mean} = \frac{\sum \text{all numbers}}{\text{total number of values}} = \frac{10 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 30 + 30 + 40 + 50 + 70 + 70 + 80}{11} = \frac{440}{11} = 40$
    
2. **Median**: The median is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in ascending order. Since there are 11 numbers, the median is the 6th number. $\text{Median} = 30$
    
3. **Mode**: The mode is the number that appears most frequently. $\text{Mode} = 20 \quad (\text{appears 3 times})$
    

So, the mean is 40, the median is 30, and the mode is 20. If you have any other questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
