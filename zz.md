Thee consumption of cigarettes generates external costs on the society, and this society had no say in deciding whether or not to consume that good. The diagram below represents the negative externality arising from smoking : (graph)

I chose this exploration because I have a passion for Physics, especially for the electromagnetism topic. I have a keen interest In circuit building and have always wanted to know more about the electronic devices we use in our daily lives. Personally, I find it fascinating how imagmary numbers may make real life applications of mathematics easier, especially in circuits ililich is arguably more focused on the experimental as opposed to the theoretical part of physics.
