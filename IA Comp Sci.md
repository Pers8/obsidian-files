`Since Criterion A and Criterion E are both worth 6 marks, and Criterion C is worth 12 marks, it makes sense to divide the word count accordingly: Criterion A and E: 500 words each. Criterion C: 1000 words.`
# Criterion A

### Scenario/Solution
My client is a professional freelancer based in the Philippines. he operates on an international scale, primarily collaborating with top Roblox developers from the United States. One of the significant challenges he encounters in her line of work is the delay in response time. This is primarily due to the substantial timezone differences between him and his clients. This issue has been a persistent obstacle in her path to providing efficient service, which led her to hire me to automate his website, aiming to address this problem and improve her business operations.

The solution we discussed involves the creation of an automated website. This website is not just a tool to save her time but also a platform to enhance her client reach through its appealing design. The website will serve as a digital portfolio where he can display her work. It will also enable clients to place orders based on their specific requirements, such as Icons, Thumbnails, and more. Moreover, the website will provide clients with the ability to manage their orders directly. This feature will be accessible both on the website and through Discord, offering flexibility and convenience to the clients. The website will also feature a secure login system. This system will allow him to update his work portfolio, add new offerings, and even offer discounts to his clients. This comprehensive solution aims to streamline her business processes, improve her service delivery, and ultimately enhance the overall client experience. By addressing the timezone issue and providing a platform for seamless interaction, the website is expected to propel her business to new heights.

Mon client est un freelancer professionnel basé aux Philippines. Il opère à l'échelle internationale, collaborant principalement avec les meilleurs développeurs Roblox des États-Unis. L'un des défis majeurs qu'il rencontre dans son travail est le délai de réponse. Cela est principalement dû aux différences substantielles de fuseaux horaires entre lui et ses clients. Ce problème a été un obstacle persistant à la fourniture d'un service efficace, ce qui l'a amené à m'engager pour automatiser son site web, dans le but de résoudre ce problème et d'améliorer ses opérations commerciales.

La solution dont nous avons discuté implique la création d'un site web automatisé. Ce site n'est pas seulement un outil qui lui permettra de gagner du temps, mais aussi une plateforme qui lui permettra de toucher davantage de clients grâce à son design attrayant. Le site web servira de portfolio numérique où il pourra présenter son travail. Il permettra également aux clients de passer des commandes en fonction de leurs besoins spécifiques, tels que les icônes, les vignettes, etc. De plus, le site web permettra aux clients de gérer directement leurs commandes. Cette fonction sera accessible à la fois sur le site web et via Discord, offrant flexibilité et commodité aux clients. Le site web comprendra également un système de connexion sécurisé. Ce système lui permettra de mettre à jour son portfolio, d'ajouter de nouvelles offres et même de proposer des réductions à ses clients. Cette solution globale vise à améliorer sa prestation de services et, en fin de compte, à améliorer l'expérience globale du client. En réglant le problème du fuseau horaire et en fournissant une plateforme d'interaction transparente, le site web devrait propulser son nombre de commandes vers de nouveaux sommets.

# Criterion B



I'm a freelancer in Philippines, I work internationally and mostly handle US Clients that are top Roblox developers. my current Issue is response time, due to very different timezones I cannot respond very quickly to half of my Clients, this is why I hired Pers to build and automate my website. This website wont just save me time, it would help me attract more Clients due to the appealing design. I'll be able to showcase my work directly from my website and they will be able to take orders depending on what they want ( Icons, Thumbnails, etc... ), and they could manage their orders directly on the website and through Discord. The website would also enable me to add more work and even add discounts through a login system.



I decided to use Java to create the solution as Java can be run on both Windows and MacOS, meaning that there would be no restrictions on what type of work laptop my client must use. Furthermore, by styling the program, it would be made more aesthetically pleasing and simple to
use for my client. I chose to use JavaFX GUI toolkit in lieu of Java Swing as Swing may be considered outdated and not as aesthetically pleasing.
My client stated that he had used other online quiz programs such as Quizlet and Memrise, however for those apps to download the flashcards offline, he needed to install the mobile apps and upgrade to a paid membership (research in Appendix). Therefore, he wanted to have a suitable alternative that fulfilled his needs and worked offline, creating the necessity for a custom application. The application will help the client to store inputted words, and create a quiz based on stored data.

Can you continue by writing this which is the rationale part of the criterion A. This is an example of structure and I'll use VS code as my code editor, html, css and js. Explain also why I chose them like he did
