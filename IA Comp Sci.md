`Since Criterion A and Criterion E are both worth 6 marks, and Criterion C is worth 12 marks, it makes sense to divide the word count accordingly: Criterion A and E: 500 words each. Criterion C: 1000 words.`
# Criterion A

### Scenario/Issue
The client is a businessman in China. As when on business trips, he often would visit predominantly English-speaking countries like UK and US, he is required to speak English to a proficient level. Currently the client can speak very simple English and form simple sentences. My client mentioned that he would like to improve his English vocabulary when meeting with clients, as he often reuses the same adjectives when describing objects, and hence we decided to discuss a solution (our conversations are in the Appendix).
My client discussed with me what he wanted me to achieve: a simple program that can run on his work laptop. In the program, he wanted to be able to input a Chinese word or phrase and wanted to be able to input the relevant English meaning to the side. He wanted to be able to view all the
words/phrases he had inputted at any time and be able to save them. He also wanted to be able for the program to create a simple quiz / flashcards for him so he could learn the words at his leisure. Furthermore, he wanted to be able to use the program when not connected to the internet, as he
often worked when travelling, and would like to incorporate key words when writing documents. Lastly, he wanted the program to be simple to use and not over-complicated.
