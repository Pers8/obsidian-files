`Since Criterion A and Criterion E are both worth 6 marks, and Criterion C is worth 12 marks, it makes sense to divide the word count accordingly: Criterion A and E: 500 words each. Criterion C: 1000 words.`
# Criterion A

### Scenario/Solution
The client is a businessman in China. As when on business trips, he often would visit predominantly English-speaking countries like UK and US, he is required to speak English to a proficient level. Currently the client can speak very simple English and form simple sentences. My client mentioned that he would like to improve his English vocabulary when meeting with clients, as he often reuses the same adjectives when describing objects, and hence we decided to discuss a solution (our conversations are in the Appendix).
My client discussed with me what he wanted me to achieve: a simple program that can run on his work laptop. In the program, he wanted to be able to input a Chinese word or phrase and wanted to be able to input the relevant English meaning to the side. He wanted to be able to view all the
words/phrases he had inputted at any time and be able to save them. He also wanted to be able for the program to create a simple quiz / flashcards for him so he could learn the words at his leisure. Furthermore, he wanted to be able to use the program when not connected to the internet, as he
often worked when travelling, and would like to incorporate key words when writing documents. Lastly, he wanted the program to be simple to use and not over-complicated.
### Rationale

### Success Criteria

1. User is able to see prices and all my works in 1 website
2. Website is automated and linked to a Discord Server
3. Orders can be managed and created directly from the website
4. User is able to easily order multiple items at a time

# Criterion B



I'm a freelancer in Philippines, I work internationally and mostly handle US Clients that are top Roblox developers. my current Issue is response time, due to very different timezones I cannot respond very quickly to half of my Clients, this is why I hired Pers to build and automate my website. This website wont just save me time, it would help me attract more Clients due to the appealing design. I'll be able to showcase my work directly from my website and they will be able to take orders depending on what they want ( Icons, Thumbnails, etc... ), and they could manage their orders directly on the website and through Discord. The website would also enable me to add more work and even add discounts through a login system.



I decided to use Java to create the solution as Java can be run on both Windows and MacOS, meaning that there would be no restrictions on what type of work laptop my client must use. Furthermore, by styling the program, it would be made more aesthetically pleasing and simple to
use for my client. I chose to use JavaFX GUI toolkit in lieu of Java Swing as Swing may be considered outdated and not as aesthetically pleasing.
My client stated that he had used other online quiz programs such as Quizlet and Memrise, however for those apps to download the flashcards offline, he needed to install the mobile apps and upgrade to a paid membership (research in Appendix). Therefore, he wanted to have a suitable alternative that fulfilled his needs and worked offline, creating the necessity for a custom application. The application will help the client to store inputted words, and create a quiz based on stored data.
