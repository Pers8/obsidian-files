The story is written in the first person, from the perspective of an unnamed woman who has been suffering from a nervous disorder after giving birth to her child. She is confined to a bedroom in a house for the summer, with nothing to do but stare at the yellow wallpaper. As the days pass, she begun seeing a woman trapped inside the pattern of the wallpaper and becomes convinced that she must set the woman free. Also John, who is also a physician, dismisses her fears and concerns about her illness and insists that she needs nothing more than rest and quiet. He has forbidden her from writing, reading, or doing anything else that might stimulate her mind.

As the woman's obsession with the wallpaper grows, so does her sense of confinement and isolation. She becomes increasingly disconnected from reality, losing touch with her sense of self and descending into madness.

In the end, the woman tears down the wallpaper in an attempt to free the woman she believes is trapped inside, only to find that she has been freeing herself from her own confinement and madness. The story is a powerful commentary on the treatment of women's mental health during the 19th century, as well as a haunting exploration of the human psyche and the dangers of confinement and isolation.
