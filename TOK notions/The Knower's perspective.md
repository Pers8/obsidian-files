[[TOK]] > [[The Knower's perspective]]

The word Perspective can be defined as a point of view, a particular way of seeing or considering something.
All of us, as knowers, bring our own perspective to every situation from the people and places we like to the political opinions we hold. If you go back to the things, you liked or disliked when you were very young, you would probably have different opinions of them now. As our perspectives change so to do our taste and opinions. Sometimes, our personal perspective can help us to understand others. At all the times, it can prevent us from understanding or even one thing to understand their opinions and their point of view.
