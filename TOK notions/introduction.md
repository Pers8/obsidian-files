## **INTRODUCTION :** Real life situation

1) To what extent can you know yourself
2) In what contexts is it possible for others to know you better than you know yourself

**Answers :**

1) I know myself by knowing my aptitudes, by knowing what i can and cannot do
2) 


The question " **Who is the knower?** " has occupied the mind of philosophers and great thinkers for thousand of years, and is perhaps no closer to a definitive answer that it has ever been. Yet, if we cannot know who we are as knowers, how can we know anything. In TOK we look at what each individual Knower. How might contribute to the array of knowledge that human kind has access to. We will be interested on how we can best try to avoid deceiving ourselves or being deceived by others. We will exam where our current knowledge comes from and what has influenced us to think the way we do. Also we will be challenged to identify and question some of our assumption and biases and to raise our awareness of the extent to which who we are shapes what we know

$\underline{bias}$ : Prejudice, Favouritism, Unfairness, Partiality


We live in an age in which self identity and self esteem are regarded as crucial to our health and well being. At the same time, we are invited take part into self improvement programs, and the selfie is perhaps the fastest growing genre in the photography. 


### 1-2. The Knower as an individual

**IDENTITY** : How a person, group or nation sees themselves in relation to other people, groups, nations, ideas and the world.

**CONTINGENT** : only true on a certain condition and dependant on other's culture.

**CULTURE** : the share ideas, beliefs, costumes and practices of a community or society.

**PERCEPTION** : an awareness of something in and through the mind.
