For the area of knowledge **History**, we could ask the following questions :
- *What is being studied, and what kind of problems can be solved ?*
- *What are the limitations ?*
- *What are some of the current opened, an answered or contentious question ?*
- *Are all areas of knowledge concerned with knowledge of the past to some extent*


## Introduction

It is important to understand the past in order to appreciate our place and context now, in time and space.

## What is History ?

To answer the question what's is history we might begin that it is the study of the past. The answer is more complicated than that. History wants focus almost on telling the story of kings and queens, great leaders, military campaigns, wars and politics. There have been a significant shift in focus regarding the topics, scope and modern methodology. There are some historian might specialise in a particular time period such. In addition, history does not exists as a discipline in isolation. Historian might collaborate with experts from all the areas of knowledges, and borrow from the methodologies of all the disciplines in order to deblock related subject areas such as art history, economic history. How can we contract knowledge as part of study of the history.

“History is **an area of knowledge that studies the recorded past**. It raises knowledge questions such as whether it is possible to talk meaningfully about a historical fact and what such a fact might be, or how far we can speak with certainty about anything in the past. History as an area of knowledge **deals with human actions in time whether by individuals or communities** so it is considered a “human science” for the most part, and the approach to the study of it is a “scientific” one.

*Why do we pursue and understand of the past ?*

## A pluralistic approach

There is, of course, no easy way for us to gain certain knowledge of the past, nor escape from our own prejudices and achieve a God's-eye-view of history. Since history has often been used to promote the interest of dominant nation. Dominant nation and powerful elites, it is not surprising that some people are suspicious of the official version of the truth. In a multicultural world one might argue that textbooks should reflect the experiences of elites but also of groups such as women and ethnic minorities indeed, rather than thinking of history in the singular, it might be better to think in terms of history we have to explore the past from a variety of perspectives.

Key word : **Pluralistic history** : Accepting that there are various different perspective that maybe justified, and multiple possible accounts of the past.

*Consider the reason why we might pursue historical knowledge*

There are many reasons for pursuing historical knowledge. We can justify history on various grounds, including that it gives us a share memory and riches our understanding of human nature, is a defence against propaganda and can provide a range of perspectives

## History gives   

You can know a person if you know about his history. You can know a country if you know about it's history and collective national history. If you are to have informed opinions about current affairs, and your judgements about other countries are to go beyond mere prejudice, then a knowledge of history is indispensable. Education system will take a peculiar approach to the teaching of history. For example, a school history textbook might shape a student's sense of identity and a collective national memory. Textbooks written about the same historical person or event may take different approaches. The key issue is who interprets the collective national memory for today, and how it is represented. These issues have significant implications for knowledge and knowing

## History enriches our understanding of human nature 

History enriches our understanding of human nature by showing us what human beings have thought and done in a wide variety of circumstances. History might remind us that human behaviour can never be fully explained in terms of neat and tiddy models. If that is the case, then we might agree with the historian R. G. Collingwood who suggested that if you want to know yourself and other people better, you might want to pursue historical knowledge : my answer is that history is for human self knowledge. Knowing yourself means knowing what you can do; and seems nobody knows what he can do until he tries, the only clue to what man can do is what man has done. The value of history, then, is that it teaches us what man has done and thus what man is
