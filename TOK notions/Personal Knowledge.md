**Experiential :** It's something that you experienced, based on experience

**Innate :** It's something that you acquire naturally, you are born birth

**A priori :** purely by reason


Personal knowledge is a knowledge we personally have. Almost all of our personal knowledge is **experiential**. The exception would be any knowledge that is **innate**, that is, knowledge we are born with or things that we can know **a priori**, it means, purely by reason. An example of innate knowledge might be knowing how to breath, how to cry, knowing to search for our mother's nipple. Some people we are born with an innate sense of God.


**Theorem :** A principle or a statement that can be demonstrated or proved using logic, but is not self evident

**Truth :** In accord with fact or reality or faithfulness to a standard / a fact or belief is accepted as true


Everything we perceive about the world is perceived through our sense, so everything we know about the world is our brains interpretations of the sensory information it receives.
