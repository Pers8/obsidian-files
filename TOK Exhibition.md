**Question :** Are some types of knowledge more useful than others?

**Objects :**  A diary from a soldier in World War II, "Starry Night"  by Vincent Van Gogh, A Microscope



Throughout history, humans have sought knowledge to better understand the world and our place in it. However, not all knowledge is created equal. This exhibition explores the question of whether some types of knowledge are more useful than others. Specifically, we will examine the utility of knowledge gained through scientific inquiry, artistic expression, and historical analysis, as represented by the objects of a microscope, the work of art "Starry Night" by van Gogh, and a historical artifact that is a diary from a soldier in World War II.


**Object 1:** *A diary from a soldier in World War II*

My first object is "a diary from a soldier in World War II". I specially chose that object because it shows how knowledge can be useful in different ways. It gives us a peek into the soldier's personal experiences and helps us understand the historical context and tactical insights of the war. The soldier's personal knowledge comes from their own encounters and observations. It gives us a unique perspective on the realities of war, showing us how it affects people emotionally and mentally. The diary preserves the soldier's experiences so that future generations can understand and appreciate the sacrifices made during World War II. This personal knowledge helps us feel empathy and makes historical events more relatable. Additionally, the soldier's diary contains practical knowledge gained through training and combat. It shares valuable information about battle strategies, weapons, and survival techniques used in the war. This kind of knowledge is important for military historians, strategists, and researchers studying past conflicts. It provides a firsthand account of military tactics, revealing their effectiveness and teaching us lessons that can be applied to future military strategies.

While the soldier's personal knowledge gives us a subjective understanding of the war, their tactical knowledge has practical value. It allows researchers and strategists to analyze past military operations, find patterns, and make conclusions that can help improve modern warfare techniques. The diary acts as a connection between the past and present, offering a wealth of information that can be used for learning and avoiding mistakes from the past



**Object 2:** *"Starry Night"  by Vincent Van Gogh*

My second object is the artwork "Starry Night"  by Vincent Van Gogh. "Starry Night" demonstrates the impact of artistic knowledge and raises the question of the usefulness of different types of knowledge. Van Gogh's painting goes beyond conventional understanding, allowing us to experience his emotions and perspective. Artistic knowledge, while not immediately practical, challenges our perceptions, evokes emotions, and fosters creativity and introspection. Practical knowledge, on the other hand, has tangible applications and addresses specific problems. Both types of knowledge have their own significance and contributions, catering to different aspects of human experience. The usefulness of knowledge depends on the context and purpose at hand, with artistic knowledge offering a unique way of understanding and engaging with the world.

**Object 3:** *A Microscope*

My third object in my exhibition is a microscope which is a instrument that is used to magnify small objects. Thanks to the vastly improved resolution, contrast-enhancing techniques, digital imaging, fluorescent labelling and countless of other innovations, microscopy has revolutionize other fields such as chemistry, physics or biology.
I chose that object because it represents the power of scientific inquiry to uncover new knowledge about the world around us. Visitors to this exhibit will explore the various ways in which scientific knowledge has been used to improve human life, from the discovery of antibiotics to the development of space travel. However, we will also examine the limitations of scientific knowledge, particularly in terms of its ability to fully capture the complexity and nuance of human experience.
