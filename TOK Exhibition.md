**Question :** Are some types of knowledge more useful than others?

**Objects :**  A diary from a soldier in World War II, "Starry Night"  by Vincent Van Gogh, A Microscope



Throughout history, humans have sought knowledge to better understand the world and our place in it. However, not all knowledge is created equal. This exhibition explores the question of whether some types of knowledge are more useful than others. Specifically, we will examine the utility of knowledge gained through scientific inquiry, artistic expression, and historical analysis, as represented by the objects of a microscope, the work of art "Starry Night" by van Gogh, and a historical artifact that is a diary from a soldier in World War II.


**Object 1:** *A diary from a soldier in World War II*

My first object is "a diary from a soldier in World War II". I specially chose that object because it shows how knowledge can be useful in different ways. It gives us a peek into the soldier's personal experiences and helps us understand the historical context and tactical insights of the war. The soldier's personal knowledge comes from their own encounters and observations. It gives us a unique perspective on the realities of war, showing us how it affects people emotionally and mentally. The diary preserves the soldier's experiences so that future generations can understand and appreciate the sacrifices made during World War II. This personal knowledge helps us feel empathy and makes historical events more relatable. Additionally, the soldier's diary contains practical knowledge gained through training and combat. It shares valuable information about battle strategies, weapons, and survival techniques used in the war. This kind of knowledge is important for military historians, strategists, and researchers studying past conflicts. It provides a firsthand account of military tactics, revealing their effectiveness and teaching us lessons that can be applied to future military strategies.

While the soldier's personal knowledge gives us a subjective understanding of the war, their tactical knowledge has practical value. It allows researchers and strategists to analyze past military operations, find patterns, and make conclusions that can help improve modern warfare techniques. The diary acts as a connection between the past and present, offering a wealth of information that can be used for learning and avoiding past mistakes.



**Object 2:** *"Starry Night"  by Vincent Van Gogh*

My second object is a paint called "Starry Night" by Van Gogh. Vincent Van Gogh painted it in 1889 while he was staying in Saint-Paul asylum in Saint-Rémy, France, where he lived for a year following a breakdown and the mutilation of his left ear. Painted with oil on canvas, the artist attempted to capture the view from the window in his room.
This paint mainly represents the power of artistic expression to convey knowledge and insight about the human experience. Visitors to this exhibit will explore the ways in which art can be used to express emotions, convey meaning, and inspire action. We will also examine the limitations of art as a form of knowledge, particularly in terms of its subjective nature and the potential for interpretation and misinterpretation.

**Object 3:** *A Microscope*

My third object in my exhibition is a microscope which is a instrument that is used to magnify small objects. Thanks to the vastly improved resolution, contrast-enhancing techniques, digital imaging, fluorescent labelling and countless of other innovations, microscopy has revolutionize other fields such as chemistry, physics or biology.
I chose that object because it represents the power of scientific inquiry to uncover new knowledge about the world around us. Visitors to this exhibit will explore the various ways in which scientific knowledge has been used to improve human life, from the discovery of antibiotics to the development of space travel. However, we will also examine the limitations of scientific knowledge, particularly in terms of its ability to fully capture the complexity and nuance of human experience.

"Starry Night" goes beyond what we usually understand, showing us the powerful influence of artistic knowledge. Van Gogh's personal knowledge and artistic expression come together to create a mesmerizing painting of a sky full of stars, a peaceful village, and a vivid, expressive moon. This artwork gives us a special glimpse into the artist's emotions and how he saw the world. Van Gogh's personal knowledge, which comes from his own experiences, beliefs, and feelings, helps us understand how he created his art and allows us to connect with his deepest thoughts. Looking at "Starry Night," we are reminded of how art can make us feel emotions, make us think about ourselves, and help us see the beauty that surrounds us in a fresh way.
