**Question :** Are some types of knowledge more useful than others?

**Objects :**   "Starry Night"  by Vincent Van Gogh, A Smartphone, The world map



In TOK, knowledge is often defined as justified true belief. This exhibition explores the question: “Are some types of knowledge more useful than others?” To investigate this, we will examine three objects: “Starry Night” by Vincent Van Gogh, a smartphone, and the world map. These objects represent different types of knowledge: artistic, technological, and geographical, respectively. “Starry Night” embodies emotional and symbolic knowledge, the smartphone symbolizes practical and technological knowledge, and the world map represents geographical and cultural knowledge. The connection between these objects lies in their ability to convey knowledge that is useful in different contexts. This exhibition aims to delve into the complexities of these types of knowledge, their usefulness, and how they interact with each other in our daily lives. Through this exploration, we hope to shed light on the multifaceted nature of knowledge and its utility.


**Object 1:** *Van Gogh "Starry Night" painting*

The first object of our exploration is Vincent Van Gogh’s masterpiece, “Starry Night”. This painting, with its swirling, luminescent stars and the tranquil village resting beneath them, is one of the most recognized pieces in the history of Western art. It is not just a depiction of the night sky, but a window into Van Gogh’s mind, his emotions, and his perception of the world.
This object represents a form of knowledge that is fundamentally different from factual or scientific knowledge. It does not convey information about the physical properties of stars or the scientific workings of the universe. Instead, it offers a deep, emotional insight into human experience. The vibrant colors and passionate brush strokes express a sense of wonder and awe at the beauty of the night sky, reflecting Van Gogh’s own feelings. This emotional knowledge, while not ‘useful’ in a practical sense, enriches our understanding of human nature and the world around us.
In relation to the prompt, “Starry Night” demonstrates that the usefulness of knowledge can vary depending on the context. While scientific knowledge might be more useful for understanding the physical world, the emotional and symbolic knowledge embodied in “Starry Night” is invaluable for understanding human emotions and perceptions. Therefore, the type of knowledge represented by “Starry Night” contributes significantly to our overall understanding of the world, reminding us that knowledge is not just about facts and figures, but also about emotions, experiences, and perceptions.


**Object 2:** *A Smartphone*

My second object is the smartphone, an indispensable tool in our modern lives. It’s not just a communication device, but a hub of endless possibilities that shape our daily experiences. The smartphone is a marvel of technological knowledge. Its intricate design and complex functionalities are a reflection of advancements in technology. But beyond its physical form, the smartphone serves as a gateway to a vast array of information, from the latest news to educational resources, thus representing informational knowledge. When we consider the prompt, the smartphone offers a unique perspective. Its practicality and the immediacy of the knowledge it provides could be seen as highly ‘useful’. However, ‘usefulness’ is subjective and can vary based on context. While the smartphone provides us with practical knowledge that aids our daily tasks, it doesn’t offer the emotional depth or interpretive understanding that a piece of art like “Starry Night” does. Therefore, each form of knowledge, whether it’s practical or emotional, has its own unique value in our lives. The smartphone, with its practical and immediate knowledge, complements the emotional and interpretive knowledge offered by art, contributing to a well-rounded understanding of the world. This exploration underscores the idea that no single type of knowledge is universally ‘more useful’ than others. Instead, the usefulness of knowledge is multifaceted and context-dependent, much like the knowledge itself.

**Object 3:** *The world map*

The third object in our exploration is the world map, a representation of the Earth’s surface that has guided explorers, informed scholars, and facilitated global understanding for centuries. In our daily lives, maps help us navigate our surroundings, plan our travels, and understand the geographical context of global events. On a broader scale, maps play a crucial role in fields like geopolitics, environmental science, and history, shaping our understanding of the world.

The world map represents geographical knowledge, providing a visual layout of continents, countries, and oceans. But beyond geography, maps also convey cultural knowledge. They reflect how different societies perceive the world, as evidenced by variations in map design and emphasis across cultures and throughout history. For instance, the Mercator projection, commonly used in the West, famously enlarges high-latitude areas like Europe and North America, while diminishing the size of equatorial regions. This not only reflects a Eurocentric view of the world but also influences how we perceive the importance and size of different regions.

In relation to our prompt, “Are some types of knowledge more useful than others?”, the world map offers a unique perspective. While the smartphone provides immediate, practical knowledge and “Starry Night” offers emotional and interpretive understanding, the world map provides foundational knowledge that helps us make sense of the world. It’s a tool for understanding our place in the world, the diversity of its people, and the scope of its geography. This type of knowledge, while not immediately ‘useful’ in the way smartphone information might be, is essential for a well-rounded, informed perspective of the world. Thus, the world map underscores the idea that all types of knowledge, whether practical, emotional, or foundational, have their unique value and usefulness.
