**Question :** Are some types of knowledge more useful than others?

**Objects :**  A diary from a soldier in World War II, "Starry Night"  by Vincent Van Gogh, A Microscope



Throughout history, humans have sought knowledge to better understand the world and our place in it. However, not all knowledge is created equal. This exhibition explores the question of whether some types of knowledge are more useful than others. Specifically, we will examine the utility of knowledge gained through scientific inquiry, artistic expression, and historical analysis, as represented by the objects of a microscope, the work of art "Starry Night" by van Gogh, and a historical artifact that is a diary from a soldier in World War II.


**Object 1:** *A diary from a soldier in World War II*

The above object is a historical artifact of a diary from a soldier in World War II. For most soldiers, life was very difficult. They had rationed food, but rations did not always get through to them. If they weren't at an army base, they lived in tents or in holes dug in the ground. They often had no access to heating, hot water or other comforts.
This diary represents the value of historical analysis in understanding the past and present. Visitors to this exhibit will explore the ways in which historical knowledge can be used to inform decisions and actions, from the study of past pandemics to the analysis of political systems. However, we will also examine the limitations of historical knowledge, particularly in terms of the potential for bias and the challenge of understanding the perspectives and experiences of people from different times and places.

**Object 2:** *"Starry Night"  by Vincent Van Gogh*

My second object is a paint called "Starry Night" by Van Gogh. Vincent Van Gogh painted it in 1889 while he was staying in Saint-Paul asylum in Saint-Rémy, France, where he lived for a year following a breakdown and the mutilation of his left ear. Painted with oil on canvas, the artist attempted to capture the view from the window in his room.
This paint mainly represents the power of artistic expression to convey knowledge and insight about the human experience. Visitors to this exhibit will explore the ways in which art can be used to express emotions, convey meaning, and inspire action. We will also examine the limitations of art as a form of knowledge, particularly in terms of its subjective nature and the potential for interpretation and misinterpretation.

**Object 3:** *A Microscope*

My third object in my exhibition is a microscope which is a instrument that is used to magnify small objects. Thanks to the vastly improved resolution, contrast-enhancing techniques, digital imaging, fluorescent labelling and countless of other innovations, microscopy has revolutionize other fields such as chemistry, physics or biology.
I chose that object because it represents the power of scientific inquiry to uncover new knowledge about the world around us. Visitors to this exhibit will explore the various ways in which scientific knowledge has been used to improve human life, from the discovery of antibiotics to the development of space travel. However, we will also examine the limitations of scientific knowledge, particularly in terms of its ability to fully capture the complexity and nuance of human experience.
