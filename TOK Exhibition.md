**Objects :**   "Starry Night"  by Vincent Van Gogh, A Smartphone, The world map



In TOK, knowledge is often defined as justified true belief. This exhibition explores the question: “Are some types of knowledge more useful than others?” To investigate this, we will examine three objects: “Starry Night” by Vincent Van Gogh, a smartphone, and the world map. These objects represent different types of knowledge: artistic, technological, and geographical, respectively. “Starry Night” embodies emotional and symbolic knowledge, the smartphone symbolizes practical and technological knowledge, and the world map represents geographical and cultural knowledge. The connection between these objects lies in their ability to convey knowledge that is useful in different contexts. This exhibition aims to delve into the complexities of these types of knowledge, their usefulness, and how they interact with each other in our daily lives. Through this exploration, we hope to shed light on the multifaceted nature of knowledge and its utility.

The first object of our exploration is Vincent Van Gogh’s masterpiece, “Starry Night”. This painting, with its swirling, luminescent stars and the tranquil village resting beneath them, is one of the most recognized pieces in the history of Western art. It is not just a depiction of the night sky, but a window into Van Gogh’s mind, his emotions, and his perception of the world.

“Starry Night” represents a form of knowledge that is fundamentally different from factual or scientific knowledge. It does not convey information about the physical properties of stars or the scientific workings of the universe. Instead, it offers a deep, emotional insight into human experience. The vibrant colors and passionate brush strokes express a sense of wonder and awe at the beauty of the night sky, reflecting Van Gogh’s own feelings. This emotional knowledge, while not ‘useful’ in a practical sense, enriches our understanding of human nature and the world around us.

In relation to the prompt, “Starry Night” demonstrates that the usefulness of knowledge can vary depending on the context. While scientific knowledge might be more useful for understanding the physical world, the emotional and symbolic knowledge embodied in “Starry Night” is invaluable for understanding human emotions and perceptions. Therefore, the type of knowledge represented by “Starry Night” contributes significantly to our overall understanding of the world, reminding us that knowledge is not just about facts and figures, but also about emotions, experiences, and perceptions.


**Object 2:** *A Smartphone*

The artwork "Starry Night" by Vincent Van Gogh serves as my second object of analysis and provides a fascinating exploration of the impact of artistic knowledge, prompting us to consider the question of whether some types of knowledge are more useful than others. Van Gogh's masterpiece surpasses conventional understanding, immersing us in his emotions and granting us access to his unique perspective. This invites us to contemplate the nature of artistic knowledge and its practicality compared to other forms of knowledge.

On the other hand, practical knowledge encompasses information, skills, and techniques that have direct applications in specific contexts. It addresses tangible problems and aims to provide solutions or improve efficiency in various fields. Practical knowledge, such as scientific, technological, or medical knowledge, plays a vital role in advancing society, addressing societal challenges, and promoting innovation. It is highly valued for its measurable outcomes and contributions to human progress.

Both artistic knowledge and practical knowledge have their own significance and contributions, catering to different aspects of human experience. While artistic knowledge may not possess the immediate practicality of solving tangible problems, it offers a unique way of understanding and engaging with the world. It enriches our lives by evoking emotions, fostering creativity, and encouraging critical thinking. Artistic knowledge can inspire societal reflection, challenge established norms, and broaden our perspectives on cultural, social, and individual issues.

The usefulness of knowledge ultimately depends on the context and purpose at hand. The practical knowledge is indispensable in certain fields, providing specific solutions and facilitating progress. However, artistic knowledge offers intangible benefits, cultivating emotional intelligence, promoting cultural understanding, and contributing to personal growth. It adds depth, beauty, and diversity to human existence, nourishing our souls and providing a means of self-expression.

**Object 3:** *The world map*

My third is a "A microscope". It represents a powerful scientific tool that enables us to explore and comprehend the The tiny world of microscopic organisms and structures, with its intricate details and complexities. Through its lens, we gain access to a world previously invisible to the naked eye. Scientific knowledge, derived from the observations made using a microscope, has proven invaluable across various disciplines. The ability to visualize and study microorganisms, cellular structures, and subatomic particles has facilitated groundbreaking discoveries in biology, medicine, chemistry, and physics. By harnessing this objective knowledge, scientists have developed life-saving medicines, unraveled the mysteries of disease, and advanced our understanding of fundamental principles governing the universe. The microscopic knowledge unlocked by the microscope not only expands our scientific understanding but also enables us to address practical challenges and improve the quality of human life.
