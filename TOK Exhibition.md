**Question :** Are some types of knowledge more useful than others?

**Objects :**   "Starry Night"  by Vincent Van Gogh, A Smartphone, The world map



In TOK, knowledge is often defined as justified true belief. This exhibition explores the question: “Are some types of knowledge more useful than others?” To investigate this, we will examine three objects: “Starry Night” by Vincent Van Gogh, a smartphone, and the world map. These objects represent different types of knowledge: artistic, technological, and geographical, respectively. “Starry Night” embodies emotional and symbolic knowledge, the smartphone symbolizes practical and technological knowledge, and the world map represents geographical and cultural knowledge. The connection between these objects lies in their ability to convey knowledge that is useful in different contexts. This exhibition aims to delve into the complexities of these types of knowledge, their usefulness, and how they interact with each other in our daily lives. Through this exploration, we hope to shed light on the multifaceted nature of knowledge and its utility.

The first object of our exploration is Vincent Van Gogh’s masterpiece, “Starry Night”. This painting, with its swirling, luminescent stars and the tranquil village resting beneath them, is one of the most recognized pieces in the history of Western art. It is not just a depiction of the night sky, but a window into Van Gogh’s mind, his emotions, and his perception of the world.
This object represents a form of knowledge that is fundamentally different from factual or scientific knowledge. It does not convey information about the physical properties of stars or the scientific workings of the universe. Instead, it offers a deep, emotional insight into human experience. The vibrant colors and passionate brush strokes express a sense of wonder and awe at the beauty of the night sky, reflecting Van Gogh’s own feelings. This emotional knowledge, while not ‘useful’ in a practical sense, enriches our understanding of human nature and the world around us.
In relation to the prompt, “Starry Night” demonstrates that the usefulness of knowledge can vary depending on the context. While scientific knowledge might be more useful for understanding the physical world, the emotional and symbolic knowledge embodied in “Starry Night” is invaluable for understanding human emotions and perceptions. Therefore, the type of knowledge represented by “Starry Night” contributes significantly to our overall understanding of the world, reminding us that knowledge is not just about facts and figures, but also about emotions, experiences, and perceptions.


**Object 2:** *A Smartphone*

My second object is the smartphone, an indispensable tool in our modern lives. It’s not just a communication device, but a hub of endless possibilities that shape our daily experiences. The smartphone is a marvel of technological knowledge. Its intricate design and complex functionalities are a reflection of advancements in technology. But beyond its physical form, the smartphone serves as a gateway to a vast array of information, from the latest news to educational resources, thus representing informational knowledge. When we consider the prompt, the smartphone offers a unique perspective. Its practicality and the immediacy of the knowledge it provides could be seen as highly ‘useful’. However, ‘usefulness’ is subjective and can vary based on context. While the smartphone provides us with practical knowledge that aids our daily tasks, it doesn’t offer the emotional depth or interpretive understanding that a piece of art like “Starry Night” does. Therefore, each form of knowledge, whether it’s practical or emotional, has its own unique value in our lives. The smartphone, with its practical and immediate knowledge, complements the emotional and interpretive knowledge offered by art, contributing to a well-rounded understanding of the world. This exploration underscores the idea that no single type of knowledge is universally ‘more useful’ than others. Instead, the usefulness of knowledge is multifaceted and context-dependent, much like the knowledge itself.

**Object 3:** *The world map*

My third is a "A microscope". It represents a powerful scientific tool that enables us to explore and comprehend the The tiny world of microscopic organisms and structures, with its intricate details and complexities. Through its lens, we gain access to a world previously invisible to the naked eye. Scientific knowledge, derived from the observations made using a microscope, has proven invaluable across various disciplines. The ability to visualize and study microorganisms, cellular structures, and subatomic particles has facilitated groundbreaking discoveries in biology, medicine, chemistry, and physics. By harnessing this objective knowledge, scientists have developed life-saving medicines, unraveled the mysteries of disease, and advanced our understanding of fundamental principles governing the universe. The microscopic knowledge unlocked by the microscope not only expands our scientific understanding but also enables us to address practical challenges and improve the quality of human life.

Can you write a paragraph for my third object in a paragraph and in around 300 words also here is my question, third object and structure :
Question : Are some types of knowledge more useful than others?
Object 3 : The world map
Structure : 
- Explain the context of your third object and develop this explanation, Explain the map's role in your life or its significance in a global context.
- Link your explanation of the context to your prompt, Discuss how the map represents geographical and cultural knowledge, offering a foundational understanding of the world.
- Make sure the point you're making about the prompt, using your third object, is not the same point you’ve made before.
