**Question :** Are some types of knowledge more useful than others?

**Objects :**  A book, a map and satellite

Throughout history, humans have sought knowledge to better understand the world and our place in it. However, not all knowledge is created equal. This exhibition explores the question of whether some types of knowledge are more useful than others. Specifically, we will examine the utility of knowledge gained through scientific inquiry, artistic expression, and historical analysis, as represented by the objects of a microscope, the work of art "Starry Night" by van Gogh, and a historical artifact that is a diary from a soldier in World War II.
