**Question :** Are some types of knowledge more useful than others?

**Objects :**   "Starry Night"  by Vincent Van Gogh, A Smartphone, The world map



In TOK, knowledge is often defined as justified true belief. This exhibition explores the question: “Are some types of knowledge more useful than others?” To investigate this, we will examine three objects: “Starry Night” by Vincent Van Gogh, a smartphone, and the world map. These objects represent different types of knowledge: artistic, technological, and geographical, respectively. “Starry Night” embodies emotional and symbolic knowledge, the smartphone symbolizes practical and technological knowledge, and the world map represents geographical and cultural knowledge. The connection between these objects lies in their ability to convey knowledge that is useful in different contexts. This exhibition aims to delve into the complexities of these types of knowledge, their usefulness, and how they interact with each other in our daily lives. Through this exploration, we hope to shed light on the multifaceted nature of knowledge and its utility.


**Object 1:** *Van Gogh "Starry Night" painting*

The first object of our exploration is Vincent Van Gogh’s masterpiece, “Starry Night”. This painting, with its swirling, luminescent stars and the tranquil village resting beneath them, is one of the most recognized pieces in the history of Western art. It is not just a depiction of the night sky, but a window into Van Gogh’s mind, his emotions, and his perception of the world.
This object represents a form of knowledge that is fundamentally different from factual or scientific knowledge. It does not convey information about the physical properties of stars or the scientific workings of the universe. Instead, it offers a deep, emotional insight into human experience. The vibrant colors and passionate brush strokes express a sense of wonder and awe at the beauty of the night sky, reflecting Van Gogh’s own feelings. This emotional knowledge, while not ‘useful’ in a practical sense, enriches our understanding of human nature and the world around us.
In relation to the prompt, “Starry Night” demonstrates that the usefulness of knowledge can vary depending on the context. While scientific knowledge might be more useful for understanding the physical world, the emotional and symbolic knowledge embodied in “Starry Night” is invaluable for understanding human emotions and perceptions. Therefore, the type of knowledge represented by “Starry Night” contributes significantly to our overall understanding of the world, reminding us that knowledge is not just about facts and figures, but also about emotions, experiences, and perceptions.


**Object 2:** *A Smartphone*

Certainly, let’s approach the smartphone from a different angle.

The second object, a smartphone, is a marvel of modern technology. It’s more than just a communication device; it’s a gateway to a world of information, a personal assistant, and a tool for creativity.
The smartphone embodies technological knowledge, evident in its intricate design and complex functionality. It’s a testament to human ingenuity and the progress of technology. However, the knowledge it provides extends beyond its physical form. With a smartphone, we have access to an unprecedented amount of information. From news updates to educational resources, the smartphone puts a world of knowledge at our fingertips.
In the context of our prompt, “Are some types of knowledge more useful than others?”, the smartphone presents a compelling case. Its practicality and the immediacy of the knowledge it provides could be seen as highly ‘useful’. However, it’s important to note that ‘usefulness’ can be subjective and context-dependent. While the smartphone offers practical knowledge, it doesn’t provide the emotional depth found in “Starry Night”. Thus, each form of knowledge has its unique value and ‘usefulness’ in our lives. The smartphone, with its practical and immediate knowledge, complements the emotional and interpretive knowledge offered by art, contributing to a holistic understanding of the world.

**Object 3:** *The world map*

My third is a "A microscope". It represents a powerful scientific tool that enables us to explore and comprehend the The tiny world of microscopic organisms and structures, with its intricate details and complexities. Through its lens, we gain access to a world previously invisible to the naked eye. Scientific knowledge, derived from the observations made using a microscope, has proven invaluable across various disciplines. The ability to visualize and study microorganisms, cellular structures, and subatomic particles has facilitated groundbreaking discoveries in biology, medicine, chemistry, and physics. By harnessing this objective knowledge, scientists have developed life-saving medicines, unraveled the mysteries of disease, and advanced our understanding of fundamental principles governing the universe. The microscopic knowledge unlocked by the microscope not only expands our scientific understanding but also enables us to address practical challenges and improve the quality of human life.

Can you write a paragraph for my second object in a paragraph and in around 300 words also here is my second object and structure :
Object 2 : A smartphone
Structure : 
- Describe how you use the smartphone in your daily life or its role in contemporary society.
- Discuss the type of knowledge it represents, such as technological and informational knowledge. Highlight how this practical and readily accessible knowledge contrasts with the emotional and interpretive knowledge offered by art.
- Link the smartphone to the prompt by considering whether the convenience and utility it offers make its type of knowledge more 'useful' than others.
