**Objects :**  A diary from a soldier in World War II, "Starry Night"  by Vincent Van Gogh, A Microscope



Throughout history, humans have sought knowledge to better understand the world and our place in it. However, not all knowledge is created equal. This exhibition explores the question of whether some types of knowledge are more useful than others. Specifically, we will examine the utility of knowledge gained through scientific inquiry, artistic expression, and historical analysis, as represented by the objects of a microscope, the work of art "Starry Night" by van Gogh, and a historical artifact that is a diary from a soldier in World War II.


**Object 1:** *A diary from a soldier in World War II*

My first object is "a diary from a soldier in World War II". I specially chose that object because it shows how knowledge can be useful in different ways. It gives us a peek into the soldier's personal experiences and helps us understand the historical context and tactical insights of the war. The soldier's personal knowledge comes from their own encounters and observations. It gives us a unique perspective on the realities of war, showing us how it affects people emotionally and mentally. The diary preserves the soldier's experiences so that future generations can understand and appreciate the sacrifices made during World War II. This personal knowledge helps us feel empathy and makes historical events more relatable. Additionally, the soldier's diary contains practical knowledge gained through training and combat. It shares valuable information about battle strategies, weapons, and survival techniques used in the war. This kind of knowledge is important for military historians, strategists, and researchers studying past conflicts. It provides a firsthand account of military tactics, revealing their effectiveness and teaching us lessons that can be applied to future military strategies.

While the soldier's personal knowledge gives us a subjective understanding of the war, their tactical knowledge has practical value. It allows researchers and strategists to analyze past military operations, find patterns, and make conclusions that can help improve modern warfare techniques. The diary acts as a connection between the past and present, offering a wealth of information that can be used for learning and avoiding mistakes from the past



**Object 2:** *"Starry Night"  by Vincent Van Gogh*

The artwork "Starry Night" by Vincent Van Gogh serves as my second object of analysis and provides a fascinating exploration of the impact of artistic knowledge, prompting us to consider the question of whether some types of knowledge are more useful than others. Van Gogh's masterpiece surpasses conventional understanding, immersing us in his emotions and granting us access to his unique perspective. This invites us to contemplate the nature of artistic knowledge and its practicality compared to other forms of knowledge.

On the other hand, practical knowledge encompasses information, skills, and techniques that have direct applications in specific contexts. It addresses tangible problems and aims to provide solutions or improve efficiency in various fields. Practical knowledge, such as scientific, technological, or medical knowledge, plays a vital role in advancing society, addressing societal challenges, and promoting innovation. It is highly valued for its measurable outcomes and contributions to human progress.

Both artistic knowledge and practical knowledge have their own significance and contributions, catering to different aspects of human experience. While artistic knowledge may not possess the immediate practicality of solving tangible problems, it offers a unique way of understanding and engaging with the world. It enriches our lives by evoking emotions, fostering creativity, and encouraging critical thinking. Artistic knowledge can inspire societal reflection, challenge established norms, and broaden our perspectives on cultural, social, and individual issues.

The usefulness of knowledge ultimately depends on the context and purpose at hand. The practical knowledge is indispensable in certain fields, providing specific solutions and facilitating progress. However, artistic knowledge offers intangible benefits, cultivating emotional intelligence, promoting cultural understanding, and contributing to personal growth. It adds depth, beauty, and diversity to human existence, nourishing our souls and providing a means of self-expression.

**Object 3:** *A Microscope*

My third is a "A microscope". It represents a powerful scientific tool that enables us to explore and comprehend the The tiny world of microscopic organisms and structures, with its intricate details and complexities. Through its lens, we gain access to a world previously invisible to the naked eye. Scientific knowledge, derived from the observations made using a microscope, has proven invaluable across various disciplines. The ability to visualize and study microorganisms, cellular structures, and subatomic particles has facilitated groundbreaking discoveries in biology, medicine, chemistry, and physics. By harnessing this objective knowledge, scientists have developed life-saving medicines, unraveled the mysteries of disease, and advanced our understanding of fundamental principles governing the universe. The microscopic knowledge unlocked by the microscope not only expands our scientific understanding but also enables us to address practical challenges and improve the quality of human life.
