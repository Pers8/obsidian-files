**Subject:** Cover Letter for Study Visa application – BEng Computer Engineering at Concordia University  

Dear Visa Officer,  

My name is Eldad Péres Njami Tchuisseu, a Cameroonian student currently residing in Senegal. I have been accepted into the Bachelor of Engineering (BEng) in Computer Engineering program at Concordia University for the Fall 2025 intake. I am writing this letter to explain my academic background, reasons for choosing Canada and my future goals.
 
Since high school, I’ve been passionate about technology whether it’s coding, building projects or solving problems. My strong background in math and hands-on experience in programming and game development have solidified my interest in this field. Therefore, Computer Engineering is the perfect blend of hardware and software and I want to deepen my knowledge to innovate in AI, embedded systems and robotics.  
 
Canada is a global leader in tech education and innovation with a welcoming multicultural environment. Concordia University stood out to me because of its strong engineering faculty, hands-on labs and co-op opportunities with companies like CAE and Bombardier. The program focuses on practical things which help applying theory to real projects. Plus, Montreal’s tech scene will give me exposure to startups and industry leaders.  

I graduated with an International Baccalaureate diploma from Le Collège Bilingue, where I was a Model Student and Class Delegate. Beyond academics, I organized fundraisers and volunteered in environmental cleanups. My internships and freelance work taught me discipline and adaptability, skills I’ll bring to my studies in Canada.  
 
My goal is to become a skilled Computer Engineer and eventually work in an international atmosphere post-graduation and hence I would be looking for international opportunities globally including my native country Cameroon.

My education will be funded through parent's savings and I will be living with my aunt that will take care of housing.

This program at Concordia is the next logical step in my journey and I’m determined to make the most of it. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Eldad Péres Njami Tchuisseu
