*A photograph of a French colonial administrator standing with a group of African servants in front of a colonial building.* - From Wikipedia in French Congo in 1905

The extract highlights the harsh behaviour of the French colonizers  against the Toundi and other African servants, who are required to continue serving and obeying their white masters. Toundi is forced to choose between his devotion to the French and his desire to bond with his fellow Africans, which causes him to struggle with his sense of self and belonging as a result of this treatment.
