**Subject:** Motivation Letter for Study Visa – BEng Computer Engineering at Concordia University  

Dear Visa Officer,  

My name is Njamí Tchuisseu Eldad Peres, a Cameroonian student currently residing in Senegal. I am excited to share that I have been accepted into the Bachelor of Engineering (BEng) in Computer Engineering program at Concordia University for the Fall 2024 intake. This opportunity means a lot to me, and I’d like to explain why I chose Canada, why this program aligns with my goals, and how I plan to make the most of this experience.  

### **Why Computer Engineering?**  
Since high school, I’ve been passionate about technology—whether it’s coding, building projects, or solving problems. My strong background in math (I competed in the Kangourou des Mathématiques and Euclid contests) and hands-on experience in programming (Python, JavaScript, SQL) and game development (Roblox Studio, VFX for "Blair") have solidified my interest in this field. I even designed websites for freelancers and an environmental awareness project, which taught me how tech can drive real-world impact. Computer Engineering is the perfect blend of hardware and software, and I want to deepen my knowledge to innovate in AI, embedded systems, or robotics.  

### **Why Canada & Concordia University?**  
Canada is a global leader in tech education and innovation, with a welcoming multicultural environment. Concordia University stood out to me because of its strong engineering faculty, hands-on labs, and co-op opportunities with companies like CAE and Bombardier. The program’s focus on practical learning matches my learning style—I thrive when applying theory to real projects. Plus, Montreal’s vibrant tech scene will give me exposure to startups and industry leaders.  

### **My Academic & Extracurricular Background**  
I graduated with an International Baccalaureate diploma from Le Collège Bilingue, where I was a Model Student and Class Delegate—roles that honed my leadership and teamwork skills. Beyond academics, I organized fundraisers (like the 2M CFA sanitary towels donation project) and volunteered in environmental cleanups, showing my commitment to community growth. My internships (WINEOS-Group, Daniel Sorano Theater) and freelance work (website design, tutoring math online) taught me discipline and adaptability—skills I’ll bring to my studies in Canada.  

### **Career Goals & Plans After Graduation**  
My goal is to become a skilled Computer Engineer and eventually launch a tech startup in Cameroon/Senegal, focusing on AI-driven solutions for local challenges. The advanced training I’ll receive at Concordia—especially in AI (I’ve already dabbled in TensorFlow) and hardware systems—will equip me to contribute meaningfully to Africa’s growing tech industry. I have strong ties back home (family, community projects) and fully intend to return after my degree to apply what I’ve learned.  

### **Financial Preparedness & Ties to Home Country**  
My education will be funded through family savings and my past freelance earnings. My roots in Cameroon and Senegal are deep—my family, volunteer work, and career aspirations are all here. Canada is a stepping stone, not a permanent destination.  

### **Conclusion**  
This program at Concordia is the next logical step in my journey, and I’m determined to make the most of it. I’d be grateful for the chance to contribute my skills to Canadian academia while preparing to innovate back home. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,
