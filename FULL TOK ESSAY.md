The historian without his facts is rootless and futile; the facts without their historian are dead and meaningless." Historian Edward H. Carr argues that historians shape the past through their interpretations, and the production of history depends on the relationship between knowledge and methodology. Similarly, it could be argued that art depends on the process of its creation. However, a dependent relationship is not necessarily a deterministic one. Deterministic relations are ones where the knowledge created depends entirely on the methodology. In history, methodologies can be defined as the different approaches to studying history, like historiography or quantification. In art, methodologies are the different mediums or creative approaches to making art. This essay aims to examine the relationship between knowledge and
methodology in history and the arts, and consider what implications these relationships
hold.
