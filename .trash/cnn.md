 z zConvolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a type of artificial neural network that are often used for image classification and recognition tasks. They are called "convolutional" because they use a technique called convolution to filter the input image and extract features from it that are relevant for the task at hand.

CNNs are particularly well-suited for image classification and recognition tasks because they are able to automatically learn hierarchical feature representations from the data, which allows them to effectively recognize patterns and classify images based on those patterns. They are also able to handle input images of varying sizes and aspect ratios, making them highly flexible and effective for a wide range of image recognition tasks.

To train a CNN for image classification, you will need a large dataset of labelled images, as well as a robust training procedure that involves optimizing the network's parameters through backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent. There are many open-source CNN architectures and pretrained models available online that you can use as a starting point for your own image classification and recognition tasks.
