**1) In your IB science classes, are you doing any real science?**
We are doing theorical Physics, Biology, Chemistry and Computer Science

**2) Write down in order the various subheadings you have actually used when writing up a lab report. To what extent does this align with what you already know about the scientific method?**
So first i layout the data(s), analyse it and then maybe compare if there are more than one data, give my thoughts and finally give a conclusion. 

**3) Provide a real-life example of a lab you have actually done for **
