The exploration aim is to explore mathematical methodologies used to analyze AC circuits, and to demonstrate that mathematical methods using complex numbers may be more efficient than those using only real numbers, even for real-life applications of mathematics. The focus is on impedance and phase angle for resistors, inductors, and capacitors connected to an AC power supply. This analysis explores a multitude of topics from the IB AA HL curriculum, including Euler's form of complex numbers, Maclaurin series, Argand diagrams, vectors and phasors, trigonometric functions because of AC's periodic motion, differentiation, integration, as well as differential equations to highlight the need for complex numbers in AC circuit analysis. This investigation will first introduce the mathematical physics required, then why complex numbers should be used, the impedances of the three individual circuit components, their combined impedance represented visually, and finally a worked example problem using our findings.

I chose this exploration because I have a passion for Physics, especially for the
electromagnetism topic. I have a keen interest in circuit building and have always wanted to know more about the electronic devices we use in our daily lives. Personally, I find it fascinating how imagmary- numbers may make real life applications of mathematics easier, especially in circuits which is arguably more focused on the experimental as opposed to the theoretical part of physics.
