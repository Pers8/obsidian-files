**Science** is both a body of knowledge and process of discovery. It explores the natural world from subatomic particules through the galaxies that make our universe, and everything  that falls in-between. The  Natural Sciences explore and try to understand the natural world around us. In essence, this is the physical world and the forces acting upon it. Under the umbrella oof the natural sciences come the life sciences,  which are the branches of Biology and the physical sciences, which include discipline such as Chemistry, Physics, and the earth sciences.


ACTIVITY : REAL-LIFE SITUATIONS
**Think about the general steps involved when you do an experiment in science.**
Generally before doing an experiment, you first try to understand the theoretical idea of the experiment before actually doing it. After you try to realize the experience and then analyse it before giving a conclusion.
**To what extent might goes steps changed depending on the experiment you are conducting ?**

SICENTIFIC METHOD :
Scientific knowledge is based on observation and experimentation, along with the formulation of hypotheses. This has led to remarquable progress in our understanding of the world, because it involves analysing evidences and a drawing conclusion. Sometimes, these conclusions helped to form the basis of new theories that may even go against main stream beliefs and doctrines of the time. Sometimes, scientists, however, will devise new theories before they have clear evidence for them design experiment to test the theories

KEY WORDS :
**Polymath:** a person with expertise in several fields of knowledge
**Empirical:** based on and verified by observation and experience
**Hypothesis:** a provisional explanation based on limited evidence that provides a starting point for further investigations
**Scientific methods:** a method of procedure for the way scientific investigations are conducted 

We often refer to the scientific method as if were a single way of correctly doing science or acquiring reliable knowledge, there is no set of fixed steps that scientists always follow. Instead, there are many different ways of doing science. What they share is an empirical approach that involves a lot of practices including : asking questions or defining problems, planning and cutting out investigations, design and creating models, analysing and interpreting data, looking for patterns, building possible explanations, making , assessing results and theories, communicating results
