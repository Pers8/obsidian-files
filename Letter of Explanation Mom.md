**Subject:** Explanation of Tax Documentation

I am writing to clarify my financial situation regarding my child’s application for [Bursary Name]. I am currently a homemaker with no formal employment or taxable income. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, I held remunerated employment, but since then, I have not engaged in any taxable work. While I occasionally sell small items informally through WhatsApp to support our family, this activity does not generate reported income or require tax filings.

My spouse, Théodore Tchuisseu, is now the sole income earner in our household. His tax documentation has been provided in the "Father’s Governmental Income Tax Notice of Assessment" section of the application.

Please let me know if further clarification or documentation is required. Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely,  
Annick Guyliane Choujun Njamen
