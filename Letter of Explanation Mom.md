**Subject:** Explanation of Tax Documentation

Dear Bursary Committee,

My kid was applying for [Bursary Name] and wish to clarify my financial situation. I am currently a homemaker with no formal employment or taxable income. While I occasionally sell items informally through WhatsApp, this does not generate reported income or require tax filings.

My spouse, Théodore Tchuisseu, is the sole income earner in our household. His Income tax can be found in the Father's Governmental Income Tax Notice of Assessment section.

Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely,  
Annick Guyliane Choujun Njamen
