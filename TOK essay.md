The question of subjectivity in knowledge is one that has been debated for centuries by philosophers, historians, artists, and thinkers from various disciplines. Subjectivity refers to the influence of personal factors such as emotions, beliefs, values, perspectives, and biases, on the way we acquire, interpret, and communicate knowledge. In some areas of knowledge such as the arts, subjectivity is often seen as a positive and essential feature that allows for creativity, diversity, and expression. In other areas of knowledge such as history, subjectivity is often viewed as a negative and problematic factor that undermines the reliability, accuracy and validity of historical knowledge. In this essay, I will examine the claim that subjectivity is overly celebrated in the arts but unfairly condemned in history and discuss the implications of this claim for our understanding of knowledge.

Subjectivity is not overly celebrated in the arts because it often faces resistance, criticism, and censorship from various sources, such as the art market, the public, the media, and the authorities. A striking example of this is the shredding of Banksy’s artwork “Girl with Balloon” immediately after it was sold at auction for $1.4 million in 2018. The artist had secretly installed a shredder inside the frame of the painting, which he activated remotely as a prank and a statement against the commodification of art. The shredded artwork, later renamed “Love is in the Bin”, sparked a lot of controversy and debate among the art world and the general public. Some praised Banksy’s stunt as a brilliant and subversive act of artistic expression, while others condemned it as a childish and disrespectful gesture that devalued the artwork and the buyer. The subjectivity of Banksy’s art, which challenges the conventional notions of art, value, and ownership, was not celebrated enough by those who preferred a more objective and stable definition of art. As the Turkish novelist Elif Shafak said, "Banksy reminds us that art belongs to everyone and nobody at the same time. Art is alive, breathing, evolving, and always rebelling against the status quo."
Subjectivity is overly celebrated in the arts because it often leads to confusion, disagreement, and relativism among the viewers and the critics of art. A case in point is the installation art of Damien Hirst, who is known for his controversial and provocative works, such as a shark preserved in formaldehyde, a human skull encrusted with diamonds, and a cow and a calf cut in half and displayed in glass tanks. Hirst’s art has been subject to various interpretations and evaluations, ranging from praise to condemnation, from admiration to disgust, from appreciation to indifference. Some see his art as a reflection of the contemporary society, its consumerism, mortality, and spirituality, while others see it as a mere gimmick, a publicity stunt, or a mockery of art itself. The subjectivity of Hirst’s art, which challenges the traditional notions of beauty, value, and meaning, was overly celebrated by those who preferred a more experimental and sensational approach to art. As the British art critic Julian Spalding said, "Damien Hirst isn’t an artist. His works may draw huge crowds when they go on show in a five-month-long blockbuster retrospective at Tate Modern next week, but they have no artistic content and are worthless as works of art."
The implications of subjectivity in the arts are significant for our understanding of knowledge and the knower. If subjectivity is overly celebrated in the arts, it may lead to a loss of objectivity, standards and criteria for evaluating art. It may also result in a lack of communication, consensus and dialogue among different artistic communities and audiences. On the other hand, if subjectivity is unfairly condemned in the arts, it may stifle creativity, diversity and expression. It may also impose a rigid and narrow view of art that excludes alternative perspectives and voices. Therefore, a balance between subjectivity and objectivity is desirable in the arts as it allows for both personal and public responses to art as well as for critical and creative thinking. Subjectivity in the arts also relates to the optional themes of knowledge and technology, and knowledge and politics. Technology can enhance or diminish subjectivity in the arts, depending on how it is used and accessed. For example digital tools can enable artists to create new forms of art that challenge conventional boundaries and invite multiple interpretations. However, technology can also limit subjectivity in the arts, if it is controlled by powerful interests or used to manipulate or deceive the viewers. Politics can also influence subjectivity in the arts as it can shape the social and cultural contexts in which art is produced and consumed. For example political movements can inspire or suppress artistic expression depending on their values and agendas. Moreover, politics can affect subjectivity in the arts if it imposes censorship, propaganda, or ideology on art.

Subjectivity is unfairly condemned in history because it is seen as a source of bias and relativism. Many historians and philosophers of history have advocated for an objective, scientific, and factual approach to history, based on the natural sciences. They have argued that subjectivity undermines historical knowledge and leads to conflicting interpretations of the past. However, subjectivity is necessary in history as it allows historians to interpret the past from different perspectives and to challenge the dominant narratives. An example of how subjectivity can change historical interpretation is the case of the Dead Sea Scrolls, ancient manuscripts that contain texts from various religious groups, including the Essenes, a Jewish sect in the desert. The scrolls have changed the understanding of Judaism and Christianity such as their origins, development, diversity, and relationship. Some scholars have linked Jesus and his followers to the Essenes while others have denied this. The interpretation of the scrolls varies with the subjectivity of the historians and scholars. A key thinker who defended subjectivity in history was Wilhelm Dilthey, a German philosopher and historian who distinguished between the natural sciences and the human sciences. Dilthey argued that the human sciences, such as history, require a different method of understanding than the natural sciences because they deal with the lived experiences, meanings, and values of human beings. He proposed the concept of verstehen or interpretive understanding as the appropriate way of accessing and explaining the historical phenomena. He claimed that subjectivity is not a hindrance but a precondition for historical understanding.
Subjectivity is not unfairly condemned in history because it can compromise the truthfulness of historical knowledge. Subjectivity can introduce bias and manipulation into the historical inquiry, influencing the selection and interpretation of historical sources. It can also lead to conflicting and contradictory interpretations of the past, reflecting the personal, political or ideological interests and agendas of the historians and scholars. A real life example of how subjectivity can affect history is the case of the conflict in Israel and Palestine. This conflict involves complex and controversial historical issues such as the origins, causes and consequences of the disputes, the rights and claims of the parties, and the roles and responsibilities of the international community. The need for accurate and objective information is essential for the welfare of the civilians involved in the conflict and the judgments of the actions of the governments involved. However, subjectivity can undermine the quality and credibility of the information as it can result in fake news, propaganda or misinformation. These can cause many problems such as confusion or misunderstanding and prevent the resolution of the conflicts. One quote from an established thinker that supports this view is from the British historian and philosopher R.G. Collingwood, who said: "The historian is not a mere collector of facts, but a thinker who tries to understand the past by reconstructing the thoughts of the historical actors. The historian must be objective, critical, and rational, and avoid any bias, prejudice, or emotion that might distort his or her judgment."
If subjectivity were better accepted in history, this would change the nature and status of historical knowledge. it would mean history is not a single, objective and universal history of the past but a plural, subjective and contextual history. It would also mean that historical knowledge is not a fixed, stable and certain product but a dynamic, evolving and provisional process. This would affect how different knowers interpret past events as it would recognize the diversity, complexity, and dynamism of human experience and understanding. It would also promote critical and creative thinking as well as dialogue and debate between different communities and historical audiences. Subjectivity in history is also linked to the central theme of knowledge and the knower, as well as the optional themes of knowledge and technology and knowledge and politics. Knowledge and the Knower examines how the identities, values, and perspectives of historians and historical actors shape and are shaped by historical knowledge. Knowledge and Technology explores how technology can enable or constrain the production and dissemination of historical knowledge and the access and evaluation of historical sources. Knowledge and Politics studies how politics can influence or manipulate the creation and communication of historical knowledge and the recognition and representation of different historical narratives.

In conclusion, subjectivity is neither overly celebrated in the arts nor unfairly condemned in history. It plays a crucial role in both areas, encouraging creativity and critical thinking in the arts while inviting diverse perspectives and deeper understanding in history. Embracing subjectivity enriches our appreciation of the arts and deepens our comprehension of historical events impacting the real world by promoting a more inclusive and multifaceted view of knowledge. Subjectivity should therefore be judiciously acknowledged and critically evaluated in both areas to enhance our collective wisdom.

# Exhibition :

My first object is a painting of Starry Night by Vincent van Gogh from an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. This painting is one of the most famous and influential works of art in history, and it depicts a night sky filled with swirling stars, a moon, and a village below. In everyday life and popular culture, the term "art appreciation" is usually used to mean the ability to appreciate the beauty and meaning of artworks, as opposed to scientific or factual knowledge. This aesthetic knowledge is often seen as the most subjective and personal type of knowledge to have. In this case, the association with paintings can sometimes be used in a positive way to suggest that the person has a unique and expressive knowledge of the world, or a knowledge that transcends the ordinary. 
I chose this particular painting because whilst the artist gives me much aesthetic and emotional knowledge about his vision and feelings, he also uses scientific and mathematical knowledge to create the effects and patterns in the painting (e.g.the turbulent flow of the stars). In this way, this painting is both an important way of expressing and communicating aesthetic knowledge but also of applying scientific and mathematical knowledge that the artist learned through observation and experimentation. 
This painting brings together aesthetic knowledge and scientific/mathematical knowledge into one product, just as I bring my artistic interest and my knowledge of physics and calculus. I believe that my appreciation of the painting is much deeper as a result of being able to understand the principles and methods behind the painting and analyze the features and symbols in the painting. In this way, my having the scientific/mathematical knowledge of how the painting was made enriches my appreciation and interpretation of the aesthetic knowledge that the painting conveys.

My second object is my smartphone, which is about three years old, and is from a store in London. This smartphone is used by me to communicate, access information, entertain myself, and perform various tasks. In the modern and fast-paced world, having a smartphone is almost essential for many people, as it allows them to stay connected, informed, and productive. It was reported that the average smartphone user spends about three hours a day on their device.
I chose this object carefully to help show that both content-based and procedural knowledge are useful, but in different ways and contexts, and that sometimes actually content-based knowledge is more useful. Often procedural knowledge is seen as the most practical and applicable type of knowledge. However, this does not mean that this type of knowledge is always the most useful. The smartphone is a great example of the usefulness of content-based knowledge, because if I did not have the knowledge of how to use the various features and functions of my smartphone, then I would not be able to benefit from it. The smartphone is a great example of the usefulness of content-based knowledge, because it is a device that contains and provides a vast amount of information, which I can access and apply in various situations.
This smartphone shows an example where the implication of not having this theoretical type of knowledge would be very limiting, or even frustrating, and I would miss out on many opportunities. In this situation, no amount of procedural knowledge would be helpful to me if I didn't have the content-based knowledge of how to actually use my smartphone. They highlight that it is a mistake to dismiss content-based knowledge as not as important or useful as procedural knowledge, as sometimes the implications of not having content-based knowledge can be far more significant and beneficial for us than the implications of not having procedural knowledge.

My third object is the world map that hangs in my room. It is a detailed representation of the Earth's surface, showing the continents, countries, oceans, and other features. I have always been fascinated by geography and the diversity of cultures and environments around the world. Therefore, this map is a tool that I use to gain knowledge on how different places and people are connected and influenced by each other. 
I have a personal attachment to this map, as it reminds me of the places I have visited or want to visit, and the stories and experiences I have learned from them. It is a source of inspiration and motivation for me to explore and learn more about the world. The map is not permanent or objective, as it changes over time and depends on the perspective and purpose of the mapmaker. It is a product of human knowledge and interpretation, which can be influenced by factors such as politics, culture, history, and technology. For example, some maps may show different names, borders, or projections of the same areas, depending on who made them and when. Therefore, the map is not only a tool to acquire knowledge, but also a tool to question and evaluate knowledge. 
The map is relevant to my prompt because it shows that knowledge is not static or universal, but dynamic and contextual. Different types of knowledge may have different values and applications, depending on the situation and the knower. For example, a map may be useful for navigation, but not for understanding the culture or history of a place. Likewise, a map may be useful for one person, but not for another, depending on their interests and needs. Therefore, the map is a good example of how in human and natural sciences, such as geography, biology, and economics, different types of knowledge may be more or less useful, depending on the context and the criteria.



Le sujet de mon mémoire porte sur la comparaison entre l’architecture des réseaux de neurones convolutifs ResNet et celle de VGG16 qui  domaine m’intéresse car il relève de la vision par ordinateur et des applications de l’intelligence artificielle qui sont des domaines en pleine expansion et qui présentent de nombreux défis et opportunités. Pour choisir ce sujet, j’ai effectué des recherches bibliographiques sur les deux architectures, en m’appuyant sur des sources scientifiques fiables et récentes, telles que des articles de revues, des livres ou des sites web spécialisés. J’ai ainsi pu comprendre les caractéristiques, les avantages et les inconvénients de chaque architecture, ainsi que les critères d’évaluation et de comparaison des modèles de classification d’images. En choisissant ce sujet, je souhaite apprendre les principes et les techniques du deep learning, qui sont à la base des réseaux de neurones convolutifs, et qui permettent de traiter des données complexes et volumineuses. Je souhaite également analyser les performances et la précision des deux architectures sur un jeu de données d’images, en utilisant des outils et des méthodes appropriés, tels que des frameworks de deep learning, des métriques d’évaluation ou des visualisations graphiques. Pour explorer le sujet en profondeur, je compte implémenter les deux architectures sur un jeu de données d’images, en suivant les étapes du processus de deep learning, qui sont la préparation des données, la conception du modèle, l’entraînement du modèle, l’évaluation du modèle et l’amélioration du modèle. Je compte également comparer les résultats obtenus par les deux architectures, en utilisant des indicateurs quantitatifs, tels que le taux d’erreur, le temps d’entraînement ou la complexité du modèle, et des indicateurs qualitatifs, tels que la qualité des images classées ou reconnues. Enfin, je compte proposer des améliorations possibles pour les deux architectures, en me basant sur les travaux existants ou en explorant de nouvelles pistes. Tout au long de mon parcours, j’ai rencontré des difficultés liées à la compréhension des concepts mathématiques et informatiques sous-jacents aux réseaux de neurones tels que les fonctions d’activation, les couches de convolution ou les algorithmes d’optimisation. J’ai également dû faire face à des contraintes de ressources et de temps qui limitent la taille et la complexité des modèles que je peux entraîner. Malgré ces difficultés, je me suis impliqué au maximum dans le processus, en cherchant à approfondir mes connaissances, à résoudre les problèmes rencontrés et à produire un travail de qualité.
