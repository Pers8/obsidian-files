As we delve into the world of human understanding, we encounter a puzzling situation: Subjectivity is seen as a good thing in art but as a problem in history. Jean-Luc Godard once said, 'Art attracts us only by what it reveals of our most secret self,' which means that art is all about expressing personal thoughts and feelings. However, in history, being too personal can lead to criticism. This paradox makes us wonder why subjectivity is welcomed in art but criticized in history. In this essay, we'll explore why this happens by looking at how subjectivity and objectivity work in both areas. Our goal is to figure out why art celebrates subjectivity while history often frowns upon it and to understand how these subjects relate to each other in the world of knowledge. 

Art is inherently and profoundly subjective, characterized by the profound influence of personal emotions, experiences, and individuality on the creative process. It is a realm where artists act as conduits for their innermost thoughts, emotions, and unique perspectives, channelling these deeply personal elements into their works of art. Subjectivity in art is the very essence of its existence, as it allows artists to communicate and connect with their audiences on a profound and emotional level. Artists, whether painters, sculptors, musicians, or writers, draw inspiration from their personal experiences, feelings, and cultural backgrounds. Consider, for example, the works of Vincent van Gogh. His iconic "Starry Night" is an embodiment of his inner turmoil and emotional struggles. The swirling, vividly coloured night sky reflects his profound sense of isolation and unease. This painting is a testament to the subjectivity of art, as it is a deeply personal expression of van Gogh's inner world. Furthermore, art often involves breaking away from conventional norms and experimenting with novel forms, styles, and techniques. The surrealist movement, spearheaded by artists like Salvador Dali, is an excellent example of subjectivity in art. Surrealists explored the realm of dreams, the subconscious, and the irrational, creating artworks that challenge the viewer's perceptions and invite them into a surreal, subjective experience. Subjectivity in art extends to the viewers as well. Each person brings their own unique perspectives, emotions, and interpretations to a work of art. An artwork may evoke different emotions or memories for different individuals. For instance, the Mona Lisa, painted by Leonardo da Vinci, has inspired countless interpretations and debates, making it a subject of perpetual fascination and discussion. The subjective experience of viewers adds yet another layer to the multifaceted nature of art.
While subjectivity undeniably plays a central role in art, it is essential to recognize that art is not exclusively subjective. Elements of objectivity are also present in the art world, serving as essential tools for artists in effectively communicating their intended messages. The coexistence of subjectivity and objectivity in art enriches the creative process and provides a platform for both artists and viewers to engage with art more comprehensively. Artists often rely on objective principles to express their subjective emotions and ideas effectively. For instance, the use of colour theory is a fundamental aspect of art that operates within an objective framework. Colours have universally recognized associations with emotions. For example, red may symbolize passion or anger, while blue may evoke feelings of calmness. Artists utilize these objective associations to convey their emotions and ideas to viewers. In Wassily Kandin sky's "Composition VII," the artist uses a carefully selected combination of colors and shapes to create a sense of dynamic movement and harmony. Although the emotions he conveys are deeply personal and subjective, the use of colour theory provides an objective foundation for the viewer to interpret the artwork. Composition and artistic techniques are additional objective elements that artists employ to communicate their subjective messages effectively. The use of perspective, symmetry, and balance in the composition of an artwork provides an objective framework that allows viewers to engage with the piece more readily. For instance, Leonardo da Vinci's "The Last Supper" masterfully employs the objective principles of composition to guide the viewer's eye and enhance the narrative elements of the painting. While the subject matter and emotions portrayed are deeply subjective, the objective compositional techniques aid in conveying the intended message. Moreso, the very act of creating art itself often involves the application of objective techniques and skillfulness. Consider a sculpture carved from stone or a piece of pottery meticulously crafted from clay, the sculptor or potter employs objective techniques to shape and mould the medium adding a layer of objectivity to the final artwork.

  
In History, the act of reconstructing past events is a multifaceted process that is deeply rooted in the principles of historical methodology. Historians undertake this challenging task by scrutinizing a wide range of historical evidence, ultimately striving to comprehend the intricacies of events that have shaped our world. It is through the lens of historical methodology that we can begin to grasp the notion of subjective history, which pertains to the inherent subjectivity in interpreting and narrating historical events. Historiography, the field of study dedicated to investigating how historians create their interpretations of the past, sheds light on the complexities of historical subjectivity. Unlike the belief that history is an exact science, historiography reveals that it is, in fact, a collaborative effort between the individuals who lived in the past and contemporary historians who delve into their legacies. Historians are tasked with navigating a maze of biases, perspectives, and historical methodologies to piece together the puzzle of history. For instance, consider the interpretation of a significant historical event like World War II. While there may be an agreed-upon timeline of events, the perspectives of various historians can lead to distinct narratives. A historian from one nation may emphasize their country's contributions, while another may focus on the human suffering that occurred. The use of different primary and secondary sources, coupled with personal biases, creates a divergence in interpretations. One other example that illustrates the subjectivity of history is the writing of the American Civil War. Confederate General Robert E. Lee is viewed as a heroic figure in the South, while in the North, his legacy is more complex. This discrepancy in interpretation arises from the differing viewpoints of people from these regions and their historical narratives. Historians acknowledge that subjectivity is an integral aspect of their work. While this may seemingly obscure the quest for an objective historical truth, it also provides an opportunity for a deeper and more inclusive understanding of the past. Recognizing that history is not a fixed, unchanging entity but rather a dynamic dialogue between various interpretations, historians can engage in rigorous debates and discussions, contributing to the evolution of historical knowledge. In this way, the subjectivity inherent in the field of history is not a shortcoming but a key to unlocking the richness of the past.
However, there exists a counter-claim that seeks to uphold the idea of historical objectivity. Proponents of this viewpoint argue that while subjectivity is undoubtedly present in historical interpretation, historians can strive for a measure of objectivity by adhering to rigorous research methods, evidence-based analysis, and impartial storytelling. Historical objectivity posits that there is a discernible, factual truth about past events that can be approached through careful examination of available evidence. One example that supports the notion of historical objectivity can be found in the study of ancient civilizations. Archaeologists and historians, when confronted with remnants of past societies, aim to uncover concrete facts about their way of life, governance, and culture. Through painstaking excavation and analysis of artifacts, they construct a more objective understanding of these societies. The deciphering of hieroglyphics and the study of ancient inscriptions, for instance, contribute to the formation of a more fact-based narrative about ancient civilizations. Moreover, when examining well-documented historical events where an abundance of primary source materials is available, such as the Holocaust, historians strive to provide an objective account based on the overwhelming volume of corroborative evidence. In these cases, the collective weight of evidence and documents can lead to a more objective understanding of the past, despite differing interpretations. The counter-claim argues that embracing objectivity in history can serve to mitigate the influence of personal biases and subjectivity. By adhering to rigorous research standards and prioritizing empirical evidence, historians can present a more reliable and less subjective account of the past events.

My first object is a painting by Vincent van Gogh, titled “Starry Night”. It is one of the most famous and recognizable artworks in the world, depicting a night sky filled with swirling stars, a moon, and a village below. I chose this painting because I have always admired van Gogh’s style and expression, and I have learned about his life and struggles in my art history class. The painting also reflects his personal and emotional knowledge, as he created it while staying in an asylum in Saint-Remy, France.

In terms of answering the prompt, the painting is a relevant example of how different types of knowledge can be valued differently depending on the context and perspective. Van Gogh’s artistic knowledge was not appreciated or recognized during his lifetime, as he only sold one painting and faced criticism and rejection from the public and his peers. He also suffered from mental illness and poverty, which affected his self-esteem and confidence. However, after his death, his paintings became widely admired and influential, and he is now regarded as one of the greatest and most innovative artists of all time. His artistic knowledge has also inspired and enriched the lives of millions of people who appreciate his vision and expression.

This shows that the usefulness of knowledge is not fixed or objective, but rather subjective and dynamic. What may seem useless or irrelevant in one situation or time period may become useful or valuable in another. Likewise, what may seem useful or important in one domain or field may not be applicable or transferable to another. Therefore, we cannot judge the usefulness of knowledge based on a single criterion or standard, but rather we have to consider the multiple factors and perspectives that influence its value and meaning.















The first object is a photograph of the blackboard my mathematics class uses to solve advanced problems while working in groups. Our teacher has implemented group work as a new teaching method, where those who understand the topic better and those who struggle cooperate to produce new, shared knowledge together.
This blackboard is a material tool that has helped us in the production and acquisition of knowledge throughout the demanding mathematics HL course. It enables us to write everything out, step by step clearly displaying the process which facilitates our understanding of the problem. It also enables group work and interactive communication, where individual inputs are turned into shared knowledge. Thanks to the visual language we use writing on the blackboard, it is easier for us to understand each other.
Solving problems this way was always more effective than doing it alone in the notebook. Most mathematical and physical discoveries (for example those by Albert Einstein) have been made while writing on blackboards which proves how important such a tool is for producing knowledge. It stimulates imagination, allowing a person to arrange all the information and connect them using reason. It is possible to step away from the blackboard and see everything from a distance, from a unique perspective, which enables forming new conclusions and reaching new knowledge.
Material tools help in the acquisition of knowledge, which is much easier to adopt when it is presented in an orderly way on a blackboard (or for example using models of chemical molecules), while someone is explaining it. This engages diverse ways of knowing such as language, reason, imagination, and memory. That is why material tools are often used in the sciences to combine exemplification with theoretical knowledge.

The second object is my sketchbook, which I have consistently used last year to develop my drawing and painting skills. Skills are a form of knowledge which requires consistent practice to acquire, and such practice is often impossible without material tools.
This sketchbook enabled me to exercise and gain new knowledge about creating art. The specific type of paper in it is especially heavy, so it allows me to both draw and paint inside — something most average sketchbooks are not meant for. Therefore, the tool is specifically adapted to facilitate the acquisition of a certain set of skills. I was able to experiment with multiple art tools inside — some, like charcoal, take hours of playing around to learn to use. At first, the effects look messy but after handling them long enough they turn out to be very successful.
Practicing art skills engages sense perception which makes it easier to notice your mistakes and correct them, acquiring new knowledge. Imagination is also needed to recognize how to use certain tools intuitively — many artists are self-taught — they learnt how to draw alone, with the use of simple tools such as sketchbooks and pencils.
It is almost impossible to acquire practical skills without practicing them and to produce knowledge on how to do something one often needs specific tools. Material tools especially prepared for this purpose help, often facilitating the experience of practice or making it more intuitive.

The final object I have chosen is the autobiography written by my grandfather. Unfortunately, he passed away a few years ago, shortly after finishing this book and now this is the only tool I can use to gain knowledge on how he viewed the world. Therefore, it has been a replacement for many conversations we did not have time to hold.
I had a very strong bond with my grandfather and now through faith and emotion stemming from our relationship, I can gain new knowledge while reading his autobiography. It is an account of various historical events, cultural elements and traditions viewed from his individual knowers perspective and retold from his memory. If the book had not been written no one would have had the access to that specific knowledge. 
The book as an object will most probably survive my family and one day might become a historical artefact, providing future generations with knowledge about the life of people in the 20th century. This has happened for example with accounts written by roman soldiers over two thousand years ago, which are now historical sources providing us with knowledge about their civilization.
This book is not strictly a material tool — in the sense that it does not help produce new knowledge per se, it is more of an aid which helps acquire knowledge. However, it is a good example of how in human and social sciences such as history, material tools are often the one and only way we can gain certain knowledge.







My first object that I have chosen is one of my books, a practical guide giving the reader insight into how to play the extremely complex piano works composed by Fréderic Chopin. Traditionally books tend to be associated closely with content based knowledge. In everyday life and popular culture, the term "book learning" is usually used to mean academic knowledge from books, as opposed to practical or procedural knowledge. This academic knowledge is often seen as the most important and useful type of knowledge to have. However, sometimes being "book smart" is also used to refer to being traditionally academically clever as opposed to being savvy or "street smart". In this case, the association with books can sometimes be used in a negative way to suggest that the person does not have practical knowledge of real life, or only has knowledge that lacks practical usefulness.
I chose this particular book to include in the exhibition because whilst the author gives me much background and content-based knowledge about key elements of the pieces, she also gives practical tips and aids me with how to develop and execute my procedural knowledge in the context of the piece (e.g. the practical fingerings). In this way, this book is both an important way of storing and spreading content knowledge but also of sharing procedural knowledge that the author garnered through decades of experience.
This book brings together content knowledge and procedural knowledge into one source, just as I bring my academic interest and my knowledge of how to play the piano. I believe that my enjoyment of the book is much higher as a result of being able to play the piano and try out the techniques suggested in the book. In this way, my having the procedural knowledge of how to play the piano enriches my enjoyment and understanding of the academic knowledge about Chopin.
