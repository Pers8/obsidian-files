## Methodology Essay Writing

Writing a TOK essay is not so much about answering questions, rather it is about shedding light on a knowledge question. That's what you are trying to do. We are unlikely to come up with a definite solution.

Because the TOK essay deals with open ended and contestable questions, there is an important personal element to it. While you may be able to learn form similar explorations made by others, it is important that your essay voices your opinions and arguments and that you acknowledge your own perspective and assumption as a knower.

To explore a knowledge question, you need to :
- Explain what the problem in the essay title is and why it matters.
- Clarify the meaning of any key word or key terms in  the essay title.
- Undercover hidden assumptions
