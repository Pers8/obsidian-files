As we delve into the world of human understanding, we encounter a puzzling situation: Subjectivity is seen as a good thing in art but as a problem in history. Jean-Luc Godard once said, 'Art attracts us only by what it reveals of our most secret self,' which means that art is all about expressing personal thoughts and feelings. However, in history, being too personal can lead to criticism. This paradox makes us wonder why subjectivity is welcomed in art but criticized in history. In this essay, we'll explore why this happens by looking at how subjectivity and objectivity work in both areas. Our goal is to figure out why art celebrates subjectivity while history often frowns upon it and to understand how these subjects relate to each other in the world of knowledge. 

Art is inherently and profoundly subjective, characterized by the profound influence of personal emotions, experiences, and individuality on the creative process. It is a realm where artists act as conduits for their innermost thoughts, emotions, and unique perspectives, channelling these deeply personal elements into their works of art. Subjectivity in art is the very essence of its existence, as it allows artists to communicate and connect with their audiences on a profound and emotional level. Artists, whether painters, sculptors, musicians, or writers, draw inspiration from their personal experiences, feelings, and cultural backgrounds. Consider, for example, the works of Vincent van Gogh. His iconic "Starry Night" is an embodiment of his inner turmoil and emotional struggles. The swirling, vividly coloured night sky reflects his profound sense of isolation and unease. This painting is a testament to the subjectivity of art, as it is a deeply personal expression of van Gogh's inner world. Furthermore, art often involves breaking away from conventional norms and experimenting with novel forms, styles, and techniques. The surrealist movement, spearheaded by artists like Salvador Dali, is an excellent example of subjectivity in art. Surrealists explored the realm of dreams, the subconscious, and the irrational, creating artworks that challenge the viewer's perceptions and invite them into a surreal, subjective experience. Subjectivity in art extends to the viewers as well. Each person brings their own unique perspectives, emotions, and interpretations to a work of art. An artwork may evoke different emotions or memories for different individuals. For instance, the Mona Lisa, painted by Leonardo da Vinci, has inspired countless interpretations and debates, making it a subject of perpetual fascination and discussion. The subjective experience of viewers adds yet another layer to the multifaceted nature of art.
While subjectivity undeniably plays a central role in art, it is essential to recognize that art is not exclusively subjective. Elements of objectivity are also present in the art world, serving as essential tools for artists in effectively communicating their intended messages. The coexistence of subjectivity and objectivity in art enriches the creative process and provides a platform for both artists and viewers to engage with art more comprehensively. Artists often rely on objective principles to express their subjective emotions and ideas effectively. For instance, the use of colour theory is a fundamental aspect of art that operates within an objective framework. Colours have universally recognized associations with emotions. For example, red may symbolize passion or anger, while blue may evoke feelings of calmness. Artists utilize these objective associations to convey their emotions and ideas to viewers. In Wassily Kandinsky's "Composition VII," the artist uses a carefully selected combination of colors and shapes to create a sense of dynamic movement and harmony. Although the emotions he conveys are deeply personal and subjective, the use of colour theory provides an objective foundation for the viewer to interpret the artwork. Composition and artistic techniques are additional objective elements that artists employ to communicate their subjective messages effectively. The use of perspective, symmetry, and balance in the composition of an artwork provides an objective framework that allows viewers to engage with the piece more readily. For instance, Leonardo da Vinci's "The Last Supper" masterfully employs the objective principles of composition to guide the viewer's eye and enhance the narrative elements of the painting. While the subject matter and emotions portrayed are deeply subjective, the objective compositional techniques aid in conveying the intended message. Moreso, the very act of creating art itself often involves the application of objective techniques and skillfulness. Consider a sculpture carved from stone or a piece of pottery meticulously crafted from clay, the sculptor or potter employs objective techniques to shape and mould the medium adding a layer of objectivity to the final artwork.

  
In History, the act of reconstructing past events is a multifaceted process that is deeply rooted in the principles of historical methodology. Historians undertake this challenging task by scrutinizing a wide range of historical evidence, ultimately striving to comprehend the intricacies of events that have shaped our world. It is through the lens of historical methodology that we can begin to grasp the notion of subjective history, which pertains to the inherent subjectivity in interpreting and narrating historical events. Historiography, the field of study dedicated to investigating how historians create their interpretations of the past, sheds light on the complexities of historical subjectivity. Unlike the belief that history is an exact science, historiography reveals that it is, in fact, a collaborative effort between the individuals who lived in the past and contemporary historians who delve into their legacies. Historians are tasked with navigating a maze of biases, perspectives, and historical methodologies to piece together the puzzle of history. For instance, consider the interpretation of a significant historical event like World War II. While there may be an agreed-upon timeline of events, the perspectives of various historians can lead to distinct narratives. A historian from one nation may emphasize their country's contributions, while another may focus on the human suffering that occurred. The use of different primary and secondary sources, coupled with personal biases, creates a divergence in interpretations. One other example that illustrates the subjectivity of history is the writing of the American Civil War. Confederate General Robert E. Lee is viewed as a heroic figure in the South, while in the North, his legacy is more complex. This discrepancy in interpretation arises from the differing viewpoints of people from these regions and their historical narratives. Historians acknowledge that subjectivity is an integral aspect of their work. While this may seemingly obscure the quest for an objective historical truth, it also provides an opportunity for a deeper and more inclusive understanding of the past. Recognizing that history is not a fixed, unchanging entity but rather a dynamic dialogue between various interpretations, historians can engage in rigorous debates and discussions, contributing to the evolution of historical knowledge. In this way, the subjectivity inherent in the field of history is not a shortcoming but a key to unlocking the richness of the past.
However, there exists a counter-claim that seeks to uphold the idea of historical objectivity. Proponents of this viewpoint argue that while subjectivity is undoubtedly present in historical interpretation, historians can strive for a measure of objectivity by adhering to rigorous research methods, evidence-based analysis, and impartial storytelling. Historical objectivity posits that there is a discernible, factual truth about past events that can be approached through careful examination of available evidence. One example that supports the notion of historical objectivity can be found in the study of ancient civilizations. Archaeologists and historians, when confronted with remnants of past societies, aim to uncover concrete facts about their way of life, governance, and culture. Through painstaking excavation and analysis of artifacts, they construct a more objective understanding of these societies. The deciphering of hieroglyphics and the study of ancient inscriptions, for instance, contribute to the formation of a more fact-based narrative about ancient civilizations. Moreover, when examining well-documented historical events where an abundance of primary source materials is available, such as the Holocaust, historians strive to provide an objective account based on the overwhelming volume of corroborative evidence. In these cases, the collective weight of evidence and documents can lead to a more objective understanding of the past, despite differing interpretations. The counter-claim argues that embracing objectivity in history can serve to mitigate the influence of personal biases and subjectivity. By adhering to rigorous research standards and prioritizing empirical evidence, historians can present a more reliable and less subjective account of the past events.
